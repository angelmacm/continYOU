(2, 41, 'A Ghost Story', 'Two kids sitting in a brick wall, smoking, laughing, and listening to music. Coffee nights and slumber parties. Movies and drinks after an awful week. That’s what Joe meant to me. I still remember how terribly sad I was when we first met and how terribly alone he felt.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure I can ever forget him, even though the face of my once best friend is blurry in my mind. I remember the black hair, the pale skin that reddened with too much sun or without on the cold days. I remember how tall he was and how we could talk about nothing and everything.\r\n\r\nJoe died three weeks ago, but for me, he had been dead for years.\r\n\r\nWe had been mad at each other for a few months, almost a year. I thought it would eventually go away and we would go back to the happy best friends we had always been. That we’d find some common ground. He didn’t like that I belittled my efforts to get out of the city, and I didn’t like that he always chose to stay in it, even when he could go away. Our city was a horrible place, but it was all Joe knew.\r\n\r\nFor a couple of years, I guess we both could see the end coming, but we looked the other way.\r\n\r\nRight after I moved countries and left our two-bedroom apartment, that’s when it started. Whenever I came to visit, I stayed in my old room, now re-baptized as the “guest room”. On a specially warm December when I came to visit my parents, I also paid a visit to my old friend.\r\n\r\n‘Look at it’ Joe said revealing a tiny orb of onyx with words inscribed in it ‘isn’t it beautiful?’\r\n\r\nI looked at the sphere but didn’t touch it. It looked beautiful indeed, but there was something else, something evil about it, or rather untrustworthy.\r\n\r\n‘Where did you find it?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, we have been excavating this site for a while and they said I could have it’\r\n\r\n‘I’m not sure the museum would be okay with that’ I suggested ‘you want another beer?’ I said on my way to the fridge. The apartment was weird now. Joe had made a couple of changes to the room, there was a new couch, my old room was now the TV room and outside the window a big blue and white screen shone upon us, advertising toothpaste and junk food.\r\n\r\n‘Okay, they don’t know it exists, but hey, I deserve nice stuff too’ he said ‘no thanks’ he answered as I took a beer.\r\n\r\n‘How are things with Ali?’ I asked to change the conversation. He sighed ‘Not good then?’\r\n\r\n‘She’s fine…’ his voice trembled ‘she won’t do it again, she promised this time would be…’\r\n\r\n‘What?!’ I snapped ‘come man you can’t keep…’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t care really, we all make mistakes, right?’ he said trying to sound happy, but his face was far from it.\r\n\r\n‘Not for the third time’ I whispered.\r\n\r\n‘What’s that supposed to mean?!!’ Joe snapped.\r\n\r\nI stopped listening for a second, drawn in concern.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t give me that look’ he said.\r\n\r\n‘What look?’\r\n\r\n‘Like I’m crazy’\r\n\r\n‘Hey, what do you think about this beer I bought? It’s good isn’t it?’ I tried to change the conversation.\r\n\r\n‘I love her,’ Joe admitted ‘she’s not that bad’\r\n\r\n‘Fine’ I said. ‘I just want you to be happy’\r\n\r\nIt would take a while before we met again, he knew how much I disliked Ali and her occasional cheating. She was not a bad person, but I couldn’t say they were good for each other. He would become depressed or angry when this happened and she said she would never do it again, then after everything was fine, Joe would avoid her and ignore her for weeks. He always hated listening to my opinion, so I tried not to give it.\r\n\r\nA year passed by and I returned for another warm December at my parents’ house. On my last night, we had a big fight, one of those you can only have with someone who you have known for a very long time. It’s funny, the worst fights are the ones that never seem to make sense, I swear I don’t remember why we fought, only fragments of it, all I knew is that he had started it and that he was going to finish it!\r\n\r\nBut he never contacted me, so we never talked again. I never heard from him, he was, as good as dead.\r\n\r\nI must have received a thousand calls from my boss on the day he died for real. So when I was just returning home to my puppy, a Labrador retriever, and I was finally free of all the madness on the telephone, I decided not to answer it anymore. My cellphone must have rung about a dozen times before someone decided to leave a voicemail. It struck me as something important then, so I listened to it.\r\n\r\nIt was Laura, Joe’s mother. She couldn’t speak properly, her voice trembled and broke at uneven times, and you even could hear the tears coming out of her words.\r\n\r\n‘It’s Joseph,’ she finally managed, ‘he’s dead’\r\n\r\nMy heart sank. Dead? No, of course not, he couldn’t be, dead. I fell to the floor and started crying, the baby Labrador, Leo, came running to my side. He, he couldn’t be dead. That was the worst night I’d ever had.\r\n\r\nI didn’t fully believe it until I saw him in the casket. He wore his usual combed black hair, a long beard, and his brown leather jacket. It was him without a doubt, he was dead and there was nothing I could do.\r\n\r\nWhen they heard about Joe’s demise, the museum he used to work on send their condolences, alongside a request to his mother about a missing artifact. Laura wouldn’t dare to visit his old apartment again. Not since she found him lying dead on his bed, with blood all over the carpet. She asked me to go instead, I could take anything I wanted and if I was lucky, look for the damn sphere.\r\n\r\nI walked down the dim-lit corridors of the city streets the next afternoon until I reached the huge apartment complex where he used to live. The automatic door was locked so I had to press a button to call for the guard to come to open up.\r\n\r\nHe took a few minutes to arrive, and every damn second he did my discomfort grew bigger and louder, like an express hot pot. What was I doing there? Joseph… we hadn’t talked in years… and now his mother wanted me to collect his stuff? To look for that damn piece of onyx? This didn’t feel okay, but there was I, diving into the mud one last time for Joe. Just like I used to when we were teens.\r\n\r\nThe outside facade of the building unnerved me. It was a wreck, the paint was old and stained, peeling down. The automatic glass doors wore scratches, like scars, and the lights were out. It used to be a yellow building, with lots of light and nice glass doors. I wondered where all that had gone.\r\n\r\nThe guard opened up and guided me to the tiny apartment. He opened the door and left, running like a mouse being hunted by a cat. As soon as I stepped in I understood why the guard had left in such a hurry, the place smelled like rotting food and decay, like a stagnant feeling of the putrid coming for you. There was no light but I tiny ray of dying sunshine that filtered through the curtains. I went into the dark, blindfolded, naked.\r\n\r\nI tried to reach for the lights but the power was out. So I opened the curtains, and the window and let the fresh air rush in along with the sound of traffic.\r\n\r\nThe place was no better on the inside, if anything, it looked messier. There was food on the walls and broken, dirty dishes on the ground. Clothes were left behind all over the place and a briefcase was vomiting books and socks. I knelt over the things, it seemed to me, like someone was in a rush to leave.\r\n\r\nA loud noise made me jump, and my heart beat fast. The door closed at the same time cold air filtered through the window. ‘A ghost’ I thought for a second, but of course, it was a stupid thing to think.\r\n\r\nI looked around the living room. A rush of laughter came to my memory. Old pop songs and indie music, the smell of beer and smokes. I looked at the table where Joe and I used to sit down, drinking and smoking the night away. Talking about nothing, yet talking about everything.\r\n\r\nIt had been a long time since I left that tiny apartment, but somehow I felt like looking at a broken home, a place that used to feel safe and soothing, now torn apart by time and lost love. I used to know the exact time of the evening when the bus stopped outside the building complex and people would get out and cars would start shouting that they couldn’t get out in that part of the street, I used to know how to do the coffee in Joe’s old french press so that it wouldn’t stick or get bitter. I even got used to the blue light of that screen outside! But now everything looked different, strange… unfamiliar. The cars made no noise and the giant screen now projected a flashy annoying red light.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part was the guest room, aka the TV room aka my old room. That’s where I used to stay whenever I didn’t want or couldn’t return to my parents’ house, way before I even moved in. ‘Stay, that way I can pay you all of what you’ve done for me’ Joe would say ‘you don’t have to pay me back. You’re my brother,’ I’d say. I still wonder, where did all the kindness we had of each other go to?’\r\n\r\nI carefully reviewed the living room, the kitchen and the guest room. I made a list of everything in every room. I even took photos with my phone and all. I felt like an intruder, checking on the drawers, the book stands, and shelves. I was looking for stolen property, looking for memories, photographs, or something that reminded me of my lost friend, but all I ever found were the thousands of books I had gifted him. Most of them remained unopened and that made me sad, for he had lost the opportunity to live through other eyes, through visiting other worlds.\r\n\r\nI saved his bedroom for the last. I didn’t want in, every time I looked at the door I felt a chill running down my spine. His mother found him half dead unable to do anything to save him, blood spilling out of his left arm that had stained the white carpet as if it were a canvas. I was sure the red oils would still be there and that I would be able to make up his silhouette. I’d have to get inside eventually, but I avoided it for as long as I could.\r\n\r\nIt was a long night, after all, everything I was at the moment was a robber trying to find something valuable, but not wanting inside the obvious place it would be in. I half slept on the couch in the TV room. Voices kept coming to me, happy ones, reproaching ones, songs, and white noise.\r\n\r\nAt two am I heard a noise, coming in from the main room. At first, it startled me and gave me goosebumps, it even filled my heart with unnatural pain. I wanted to run, but it was time. I approached the door and opened it wide.\r\n\r\nAn empty bedroom greeted me.\r\n\r\nThere was a closet, an old tiny TV and books spilled all over. The bed had its white sheets spread around the room, still stained with blood.\r\n\r\n‘Shit, Joe!’ I shouted ‘why would you…’\r\n\r\nIt took me a while to make up my mind, I wanted to leave, never to return. I couldn’t though, not if this was to be the last thing I did for Joe, or his mother anyway. I looked in the closet and the drawers of the TV room.\r\n\r\nNothing, not even in the toilet’s water tank.\r\n\r\nThe sun was coming up when something hit my left foot. It was the onyx sphere sliding itself through the room.\r\n\r\n‘What are you?’ I asked closing in on it. I reached my hand to take it and leave. But the tiny ball was more untrustworthy than ever. I reached for a napkin and a cloth and I grabbed them. The thing violently moved and tried to escape my hands, it tossed me to the sides until I realized it.\r\n\r\n‘Fine’ I said ‘I don’t know what the hell you are, but you leave me alone’\r\n\r\nI felt as if a bucket of ice pierced me. The sphere or that thing, whatever it was, started shaking from the other side of the room. It stopped looking at me and looked at something behind me. I swear I could see a lonely gruesome eye on it. I turned around to see what grabbed its attention.\r\n\r\nA white, translucent figure appeared before me. Combed hair and a long beard. Dressing in old clothes but wearing a distinctive leather jacket above them. He looked sadly at me and to the floor.\r\n\r\n‘I’m sorry’ we both spoke at the same time.\r\n\r\nI laughed and shed some tears ‘I should have called’ I said\r\n\r\n‘And I should have been less on an asshole’ Joe answered.\r\n\r\n‘You alright? Wherever you are?’ I wanted to know.\r\n\r\n‘I’ve been better and I’ve been worse’ he raised a white spectral finger and touched my forehead.\r\n\r\nAnd I saw it. I saw the forests and the deserts. I saw my grandmother and the times when she was a kid. I heard the noise of the downstairs avenue and then I saw two lost kids in the middle of a strange city, two brothers, but one was gone.\r\n\r\n‘That thing, it did this to you?’\r\n\r\nJoe nodded.\r\n\r\n‘I’m gonna miss you too’ his ghost answered.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t worry, we won’t let it take you too’ his voice changed, it turned cold and lifeless. At the sound of these spectral words, a thousand ghosts filled the room, all wearing clothes from other time periods, some talking, some looking as if they just woke up. They all had cuts on their wrists, just like Joe’s.\r\n\r\n‘So you didn’t?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n‘I don’t think I did’ Joe answered ‘you must go’\r\n\r\nI walked to the door\r\n\r\n‘Take this,’ Joe said, handing me his journal, some old photographs and his favorite pen.\r\n\r\n‘This might help,’ I said and gave him the ankh around my neck. I never took it off.\r\n\r\n‘Goodbye, Joe’ I said as I opened the door.\r\n\r\n‘Goodbye, Em,’ he said with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind me and I left the building.\r\n\r\nA long time passed before I dared talk about that night or before I understood what happened, what it all meant. At least I got to see my friend for the last time.', '', 'horror', 1, 1, 0, '{}', '2022-06-10 09:06:59', 4, 0),
(3, 42, 'The Graveyard Shift', 'From the basement, I take the stairs to the ground floor. When I enter, there’s a creature in the corner. It’s putrid breath reaches me; I tremor in horrifying terror as it exhales death and rot into my face. It pierces me with large red eyes, then scuttles off along the ceiling – gone as if it never existed. It\'s freezing cold, and there is no power to the building, after a small fire on the third floor damaged the wiring. So far tonight, I’ve checked through the basement where all the staff lockers, changing rooms and showers are located, plus the staff cafeteria and a temporary office for security, since the control room is out of order. There is an indoor swimming pool, sauna and a gym for tenants only. It’s rather fancy, considering it’s one of the oldest apartment buildings in town. Some cosmetic work has been done to bring it into the 21st century. Basement completed; I write on my check list.\r\n\r\nSomething touches my hand and I yelp in fright, but try to ignore it – it was probably a spider? The ground floor hosts a lavish restaurant, a cocktail bar and a gift shop, though it has no apartments. I check these are secure, and tick them off my list. Something is following me; I can hear it – the noises it makes sends needle sharp prickles upon my body. I point the flashlight behind me, but there is nothing there, though I hear loud footsteps pounding the floor. It rushes me, then backs off.\r\n\r\nI reach the stairwell to ascend to the first floor, I push through the door as something grabs at my arm, making me drop the flashlight. What I catch in the light is something God awful terrifying. It’s a swirling black mass of distorted faces. My mind cannot fully comprehend what I am seeing. Scooping my flashlight up, then pushing through the door to the staircase, the door slamming behind me gives me a scare. I stand against the door, trying to catch my breath, because I feel a panic attack coming on.\r\n\r\nI entered this building at sunset. For a minute I’m lost in the memory of the golds and magentas, spreading their fingers across the sky. It was breath-taking. Now I have no idea what time it is, I’ve accidentally left my cellphone at home. Somehow, all the clocks I’ve come across have been showing different times. Weird. Funnily enough, my watch has stopped at 6 pm, when I entered this hell hole of a building. It seems to be eating up time. But it must be well after midnight, judging by the darkness which smothers the windows; a cold empty chill has set in.\r\n\r\nI’m here because of the murders that occurred three nights ago. Eight tenants were murdered in cold blood. The police have cordoned off the areas where the shootings took place. The security firm I work for got the contract to secure the premises, and to ensure explorers and thrill seekers stay off the property. Over the past three nights, I’ve had to run off a couple of paranormal investigation teams, who begged me and offered me money to let them in for a tour. The boss would have my head on a stick if I let them in.\r\n\r\nThe apartments have been left abandoned, and the tenants are not permitted back until the investigation is through. The police emptied the place when they got the emergency call, about a gunman walking through the building shooting people with a rifle. My brother Colten is a cop and when he found out I was coming here to do security detail, he called me immediately.\r\n\r\n“Hey Gabe, how’s it going?”\r\n\r\n“Good thanks. What’s up?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I’m wondering if you want to catch up in the weekend, have a game of basketball? I’ll book us in if you want?”\r\n\r\n“Sounds good bro. How’s work?”\r\n\r\n“The murders at the Waterfront Apartments are keeping me up at night, I tell you,” he exhales and I can tell he is shaking his head, I know my twin brother very well.\r\n\r\n“Are you any closer to catching the bastard who did it?”\r\n\r\n“No, we’ve not caught him yet, but we know who he is. It’s been a difficult investigation, with all the camera footage destroyed, you know, after he shot the security guards.”\r\n\r\nColten goes quiet.\r\n\r\n“Yes, poor old Bobby Ray, he didn’t deserve that. And Luke McGee has a baby on the way,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Please don’t do it bro. I heard you were replacing them. I know you probably feel obligated, you and Bob were good friends. But it is dangerous there, I have heard all sorts of things about the place from other cops…really scary stuff, even some of the squad refuse to enter it now.”\r\n\r\n“Colten, you know I don’t believe in that crap, ghosts and demons, goblins and ghouls, it’s utter rubbish.”\r\n\r\n“Just be careful. Sometimes murderers go back to the location of the crime, for the thrill and to marvel in the destruction they caused, he is a sick bastard whoever he is. Look I’ve got to go, but I’ll give you a call tomorrow. I’ll see you at the BB court at 10 am, on Saturday. Okay?”\r\n\r\n“See you then bro, you don’t need to call to check up on me. I can look after myself, always have,” this makes us both laugh.\r\n\r\nChills afflict me as I recall the conversation, and goose pimples give me the jitters. I shake a vision away – me lying there dead in a pool of my own blood. I am jolted out of my reverie, when I glance something big and black down the staircase. I’m in the stairwell, trying to make it to the first floor. I run up the stairs, because I can feel something behind me, it’s all in my imagination, I reassure myself. Places like this give me the creeps, not from the dead, who I don’t believe in, no, it’s the living I fear. I walk the corridor and check all the rooms on this floor are secure. I check this off my list.\r\n\r\nThe murders began on the third floor, then it carried on to the fourth floor, and then the basement. There are eight floors all up. It’s a huge place to secure, and I wish there was someone else with me – this is the first place I’ve done security alone. I think of Bob and how he was murdered when he went to investigate the commotion on the third floor. He was shot dead, then the murderer used Bob’s keys to enter the control room, where he found Luke and ended his life. He destroyed the camera screens and the footage, obviously so he couldn’t be recognised.\r\n\r\nI get a jolt when I hear the door at the far end of the corridor slam shut.\r\n\r\n“Hello, is there someone here? This place is off limits, you aren’t allowed in here,” I say trembling.\r\n\r\nNo one responds. The hallway is in complete darkness, except for my flashlight. It’s a standard police issued torch that can be used to hammer someone in the head, I suppose. If it comes to that, I’ll save my own life in whatever way possible. I hear a female scream, it assaults my ears, making me drop the flashlight again. I’m all thumbs tonight. This place is freaking me out, and I seem to be chasing shadows. In the corners the blackness is deep and whole, it seems to go on forever. Like I already said to Colten, I don’t believe in ghosts, never have, and tonight is no exception.\r\n\r\nThe scream pierces the air again, but now it is closer, almost right next to me. A cold shiver feathers down my back. There is no way anyone could get in here; I checked all the entry and exit points as soon as I’d arrived. Though now the camera screens have been destroyed, there is no way for me to confirm this. I direct my light up and down the corridor as I make my way to the staircase to go up to the second floor. Something touches my shoulder and I jump out of my skin in fear. Turning abruptly, I search with my light, there is no one there. This place is playing tricks with my mind.\r\n\r\nThe second floor has a heaviness that leaves me momentarily dizzy, and I feel eyes watching me, but I can’t explain it. I’ve never been a nervous person, but tonight something inside me is telling me to run and hide. Although the foreboding feeling is strong, I manage to check all the rooms are secured, I tick them off my list. There are guest bathrooms, I check these off too.\r\n\r\nI make it out onto the landing, and start climbing towards the third floor. On the previous night’s I’ve been here, I couldn’t get to that floor as the police forensic team were still investigating. As I reach the door to the floor, a cold blast of freezing air hits me with full force in my face. I’m suddenly tired in my bones, finding it hard to lift my feet. I feel a heavy pressure on my chest, but I keep going…hoping to get the fuck out of here. I don’t want to admit it to myself, I am terrified.\r\n\r\nI scan the area with my flashlight. There is evidence that the police and the forensics team have been here. Crime scene tape has cordoned off some of the corridor, and a couple of apartments. A sound somewhere behind me has me turning. I hear screams. My teeth are chattering, not from the cold. Something isn’t right. I hear gunshots coming from somewhere inside the building, but that doesn’t make any sense, perhaps it came from outside? Regardless, I pull my taser out of my utility belt, only to be used under special circumstances, and this is one of those moments. It’s the only thing I have to protect myself. Unaware of where the noises, gunshots and screams are coming from, I walk deeper into the building. I step over the yellow and black tape, as bursts of gunfire shatter the silence. I know in my bones this isn’t right, the shots blast all around me, though they hit nothing. A huge black shadow darts past, setting my nerves on end. I carry on, I need to get this done.\r\n\r\nI check all the apartment doors on this floor and they are locked up and secure. I check the guest bathrooms, they are empty. It is getting challenging to ignore all the noises coming from every direction. I need normal noise, I start humming…That doesn’t last long, I hear a loud crashing sound. With my flashlight I search the hallway, only to find all the apartment doors are wide open...\r\n\r\n“What the fuck?” I yell, confused.\r\n\r\nThe murderer could still be here, like Colten warned me. A vision of the madman bursts inside my head. Him killing his girlfriend, and then his Mother – only an evil prick can do something like that. Him shooting two kids and their parents on the fourth floor. I hear giggling behind me, I’m stopped dead in my tracks when I spot two small shadows dark past in my peripheral. It chills me to the core. I walk faster along the corridor, and come to the spot where Bobby was killed, there is still blood dried to the carpet. Something shoves me hard, and I fall to my knees. Perhaps I just tripped on something?\r\n\r\nThere shouldn’t be anyone here but me. My adrenalin is spiking through the roof. More gunshots has me off the ground, bolting up the stairs to the fourth floor. It is dark and eerie, bitterly cold. As the door shuts me in, I feel hands all over my body, but there is no one there! I cry: petrified. I move away from the door and make my way towards the second crime scene. I’m really not supposed to be on this floor, but I need to check I am actually alone. The pressure is back on my chest. I feel hands around my throat, so I can’t scream for help, though there is no one to yell for anyway. I’m trying to catch my breath, when it tightens its hold around my neck. My scream reverberates down the corridor when I am released. I fall to the floor and I don’t have the strength to get up.\r\n\r\nPure fear grips me hard. I thought I could do this, but it is getting nearly impossible to maintain myself. I get off the floor and pull myself together. I’m trying to remember what happened, but it seems my memory has stopped working. Suddenly, I am in full throttle terror. I can’t remember arriving here. Something inside my head feels broken. I remember arriving in my Ute, I can visualise the last thing I saw before I entered: the sunset. As I catch my breath I try to remember…but it’s useless, I can’t even remember what day it is. I don’t know what is going on, but I feel like a different person, like I’m walking around in someone else’s skin.\r\n\r\nSomething scuttles towards me; I can hear its claws scratching on the walls. Pointing my light towards the sound, I see it – it’s horrid and ghastly. It’s clinging to the ceiling upside down, it’s arms are so long, they nearly touch me. As quick as humanly possible, I hoof it down the corridor to the other side of the floor. There are doors I should check, but I am too terrified to continue. In a fear so total, I make my way to the staircase. I want out. I quit: I’m done. I have never been so scared in my life. What I just saw confirms, I should not be here, especially alone. Suddenly I am livered at Bobby for getting himself killed. Now I have to deal with this shit.\r\n\r\nA memory implodes inside my mind, something Bobby had said the last time we spoke, that was a few weeks ago now. I’ve barely slept since I started working here. I’ve been carrying around this ominous feeling and it’s been messing with my head. I can’t remember much of anything, and although my memory is unreliable at the moment, I do recall what Bobby had said about this building. It was his two-year anniversary working here, and I said I was happy for him. But then he said something bizarre, that it’s not been too good recently. He was seeing a counsellor about the things that had been happening in his life, and his job here. His life has been falling apart. I tried to remind him, he has a loving wife, Nelly, and three great children. He said, the job is getting to him and that he is sure he is being haunted. That he sees things in the corner of his eye. Shadows seem to be following him everywhere. Not just at work, but they seem to have followed him home. I laughed at him, saying he obviously needs a holiday.\r\n\r\nWhen I make it back to the office, I am shaking and sweating all over, cold chills attack me. I stuff my gear into my backpack, getting ready to leave. Three knocks on the office door has me freaking out. But it could be someone coming to replace me from the graveyard shift? Or the police could be here to resume their investigation? When I open the office door, there is a man standing there with a rifle pointed at me. I gasp in a frightened breath, waiting in quiet torment for him to pull the trigger. When it happens I am not surprised. I look at him, deep into his eyes, they are soulless and black. He smiles as the trigger releases and the pain hits me an instant later…\r\n\r\nI come too and the man has vanished. I check myself over, to be sure – I appear to be okay. I get up, heading for the front doors. I try to get out, but the key I used to get in, is no longer working. What the hell is going on? I start running when I hear more gunshots from the floors above. I run to the other exits, but I can’t escape. I look back and see the hole in my stomach as I lay in a pool of blood. I am distraught. After everything I’ve been going through, one bullet ended my life. Now I will never see my brother Colten again. I should have listened to him. He has always been the logical one out of the both of us. Our parents will be gutted, I don’t think they will be able to handle this.\r\n\r\nI’m lost and all alone. Dying is not what I had expected. No cracking open of Heaven, the earth still spins. Lost in the memory of what happened, a vision nudges me as I am taken under. I see what actually happened…In my mind it plays out like a horror movie, over and over repeating itself, until I grasp the reality. I am dead. Finally I stop running. There is a tunnel and I decide to follow the light…I see Bobby Ray, he tells me to go back, I ask back where? And I wake in the hospital attached to monitors. Relief floods me, Colten is holding my hand, crying, and our parents are sitting either side of me. I am alive, I survived the graveyard shift from hell.\r\n\r\nTHE END', '', 'horror', 1, 1, 0, '{}', '2022-06-10 09:07:54', 0, 0),
(4, 40, 'Sleep Story', '\"Now blessings light on him that first invented this same sleep: it covers a man all over, thoughts and all, like a cloak; \'Tis meat for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, heat for the cold, and cold for the hot. \'Tis the current coin that purchases all the pleasures of the world cheap; and the balance that sets the king and the shepherd, the fool and the wise man even. There is only one thing that I dislike in sleep; \'Tis that it resembles death.”\r\n\r\n­- Don Quixote\r\n\r\n“I have to practice staying alive and preparing to die at the same time.”\r\n\r\n- Christopher Hitchens\r\n\r\n“Intolerance of ambiguity is the mark of an authoritarian personality.”\r\n\r\n- Theodor Adorno\r\n\r\nCW: substance abuse\r\n\r\nSleep Story\r\n\r\nby John Merino\r\n\r\n           Insomnia runs in my family, afflicting both sides of it with equal intensity. That’s nearly four centuries of Mexican tossing and Italian turning, with fits of German cursing and crying in between. A long heritage of discomfort, and, according to family gossip, one that has only been interrupted by the rotting medicines that tempt anyone who’s had to put up with an extended period of lost sleep – drugs, alcohol, compulsive anger, and every possible combination of the three. With the advent of psychotherapy, and the discovery that trauma is an actual illness and not a defect of character, many of us have learned to deal with insomnia in less destructive ways.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, my father was prescribed a small dose of the sleep aid Zolpidem, brand name Ambien, by his psychiatrist - a neat, gentle little drug that has chemical kinship with tranquilizers like Valium and Xanax, but without their addictive and narcotic qualities. To my dad, who had long suffered from sleepless nights and long days spent dragging himself through his work as an electrician, this was the answer to all of his prayers. After his inaugural dose, he smiled and drifted off into what I’m sure was the finest sleep he’d had in decades. I’m also sure this is all he remembers of that first night, and he’s better off for it. Zolpidem has a blackout effect on the mind, like a drinking binge without the hangover. My mother and I recall it in deeper, less relaxing ways. For her, it brought on the uncomfortable squeeze of an abused past, and, for me, it brought forth the very shadow of death. It was an alien shape seen in my peripheral vision that night. We all have to see that shape at least once in our lives. Knowing I’ll have to see it twice frightens me. \r\n\r\n Watching my dad’s face slacken at the dinner table after taking his first dose was distressing. It bore the stamp of deep intoxication, and it was immediate, without any intervening period of jollity or talkativeness. No time to acclimate to it. Only a high-school junior at the time, I was unfamiliar with the actual sensation of being drunk, but I would later come to know it well as a solitary confinement for the soul.\r\n\r\nIn certain quantities, liquor utterly disables your ability to step outside yourself. For the constructive drinker, often an artist, leaving this ability behind is useful and focusing, like a monk retreating into his cell to pray. Booze simply becomes a chemical means of getting to that same, isolated room. For the drunk however, who often harbors a deep hatred for what he sees in the mirror, this blind isolation is an addictive, absolute deliverance, and an absolute terror for those around him. There are few things in this world as wonderful as being drunk, and even fewer as awful as seeing someone else drunk. (This is why I’ve always thought of the designated-driver concept as something nice in theory and unimaginable in practice. Drunk people are only bearable when you’re also drunk, and being sober among drinkers has the same world-shattering effect as catching a glimpse of yourself having sex. “Is this what it really looks like when I do this?”) Blissfully sliding about inside his cell without mirrors, or even the faint reflectivity of a window, it becomes nearly impossible for anyone to make the drunk see that he is trapped, or that there is a world outside. My mother watched helplessly from outside like this for most of her childhood as my grandfather, Andrew, committed himself to this living death, dumping frightening amounts of alcohol into himself and raging as if there were no one else in the room. My dad’s face that night, so relaxed it might have melted right off of his skull, brought these times closer to her than she’d felt in years.\r\n\r\nBy the time I began to know him, Andrew had long been sober, and the sleep story he told me when I was seven was an isolated horror from an age so far away I could barely imagine it. I had no idea that he was, in his own way, doing a dry run of the apology he would never get to make to his own children. A veteran of the Battle of Iwo Jima, the Second World War’s bloodiest passage in the Pacific, and the first and only battle in which American casualties exceeded the Japanese, he recalled trying to sleep in the rare moments between fighting, curled up against the black volcanic dust that blankets the island like a mourning veil. This dust is soft and pliant, and might have been comfortable for him to lay on, drawing him down into sleep for seconds so split they barely existed. The Japanese had dug a vast network of bunkers and tunnels through the island before he arrived, and he would wake up again, and again, and again, to their muffled voices only a few feet underneath him. Imagine drifting off to the sounds of men planning how best to kill you. It’s the boogeyman in the childhood closet made real. It’s the suppressed nightmare of ancient humanity, resting in caves and clearings while hungry beasts waited behind the trees. Who wouldn’t try to drink until they’d totally drowned such a memory?\r\n\r\nSome, but not all, of these thoughts were with me as my dad began to nod off over his unfinished dinner. The absent ones, the adult ones, the ones I’ve laid down here, made themselves known that night as a warm tightness in my chest, my body figuring things out for me long before my brain did. My mother and I woke him up with a gentle shake and told him it was time for bed, but he simply hovered above his seat for a moment and plopped back down under the weight of his medication. We approached him, realizing we would have to actually walk him to his bedroom, but before we arrived, he pointed across the table and into the kitchen, calmly informing us there was a little girl standing in front of our refrigerator.\r\n\r\nI once saw a production of The Crucible in Austin, Texas, and at a climax in the play, one of the bewitched girls feigned seeing a demonic bird perched just beyond the tribunal. The actress pointed to it, and roughly half the audience turned around in their seats to look where she had pointed. I looked at them looking, and silently judged them fools. It was only a play. Did they really expect something to be there? I can’t remember if either one of us turned around to see the little girl. Such a decision, to look or not to look, is the whole ancient struggle with the material world in embryo, and it is too freighted with pride for me to remember it accurately. I’d like to say I didn’t look, my refusal a harbinger of the staunch atheism that would eventually develop out of my catholic upbringing, but that’s just wishful thinking.\r\n\r\nIf my mother and I had bothered to read the literature that came with my dad’s prescription, we would have known that hallucinations are a common accessory in Zolpidem’s package deal of side effects, especially upon its first dose. This harmless hiccup in my father’s nervous system nonetheless had a chilling effect on us, and we quickly gathered him up from his chair and into bed, where he curled up and left us to stew in our thoughts. Here is where I must speculate entirely, because, after my dad fell asleep, there is a patch of nothing in my head that looks to be about the length of an hour. Guided by my current habits, I can safely assume that, in my distress, I listened to an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 on my iPhone while I milled around the kitchen, munching on a hastily stacked turkey sandwich, the kind where the lunch meat is constantly sliding out from between the bread on a slick of mustard. There was a threat in the air that I had to escape. Birds come down onto branches and stay put before a thunderstorm, and cows lay down to sleep. I should have just stayed in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nMy memory picks up again as I cross from the kitchen into the dining room, feeling in the corner of my eye the tall window that looks out onto the lawn. A warm flood light brightens the first few feet of our concrete driveway and the right edge of our boxwood hedge. Beyond that is total darkness after nine P.M, and nothing can be seen for twenty yards except the neighbors’ porchlights across the street. Although small and narrow, it is a picture window in the most wonderful sense. At any time of night, you can see raccoons, opossums, squirrels, cats, dogs, and all manner of mammalian life slinking by to sniff and enjoy the food and water we leave out for the neighborhood strays. Sometimes, an enormous moth of exquisite pattern will flutter over and land with a thump on the glass, allowing anyone who happens to be in the dining room to admire it for hours. It’s like our own private zoo. But that night, there wasn’t a creature stirring anywhere. No crickets, no thumping moths, no hideously sleek roaches trying to get inside – a bad stillness that made me want to look away from the window as I sat down at the table to finish my sandwich.\r\n\r\nBut it still beckoned my gaze, pulling my eyes towards it like a private letter left open on someone’s desk, and, as I looked up from my sandwich, the little girl my father had seen passed by the window. I remember snapping my head back towards the kitchen, thinking my mother had come into the dining room and that I was seeing her reflection, but I was alone. When I looked back, the little girl was gone, but I was sure I had seen a tan, diaphanous dress, fluttering in the humid summer air, and young skin on a solid face, free of any adolescent blemish, shining in the porch light as thick and alive as my own. I can still see the turn-of-the-century brocade of her outfit, and the unsettling way she quickly floated by the window, as if on roller skates.\r\n\r\nA trick of the light no doubt, primed for a ghostly vision by my father’s hallucination, could easily explain away what I saw that night. But, in my memory, I can feel the weight of that girl’s body. Her reality is indisputable for me, but reality has shrunk for me as I write this. All of us are pining for physical connection like we’ve never done before. The world we miss, the one we think will finally satisfy us, is the unmasked closeness of parties and movie theaters and sex that we once knew without limit. Perhaps, for the first time in history, we wish that this really was all that there is. Hamlet’s terrifying assertion that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy has only been sharpened in the meantime, and our reunion with material life will find us totally unequipped, or, worse, totally unwilling, to confront it.\r\n\r\nI still don’t believe in ghosts, or gods, or prayers, or blessings and mystical vibrations, or any of the lies people tell themselves and their children so that life doesn’t seem like a succession of random cruelties. This is a function of privilege. I’ve never really known the dire, physical desperation that is a rule for most of the proletariat world – desperation for food, for shelter, for a face that doesn’t regard you as an obstacle, for a day spent without the wounding anxiety of poverty and parenthood. My worries have been wholly neurotic. There’s no inherent honor or intelligence in being worried about death and the process of dying. It’s a cheap anxiety that everyone buys the moment they are born, and it’s most sharp for me whenever I’m falling asleep. It’s how I react to this fear, when I’m clamped inside the space between consciousness and sleep, between life and death, that seems most important to me now. My generation likes to sneer at the ones that came before it. They were all asleep at the wheel of history and willing to take whatever heinous orders they were given to preserve their sense of security, but us millennials are still utterly unable to be alone with our thoughts. Sensing the responsibility we carry as stewards of a rapidly crumbling world, we search for disciplines that will show us the way forward, and healthier ways of beating back the impish mental chatter that comes for us when all the lights are off and there’s no one to talk to – meditation, exercise, natural supplements like melatonin and valerian root, soothing whispers and roleplays – but, come morning, we still find ourselves upright and emptyhanded, like every generation before us.\r\n\r\nI still do believe that my father’s drug, by bringing him closer to real sleep, brought him closer to death, and that this closeness allowed death to bleed into my waking life. It doesn’t matter if what I saw was real in the supernatural sense, and I don’t claim to have a better grasp on my own life because of it. Cigarettes, Benadryl, booze, and my phone are still the only ways I can get to sleep, and I remain as slavishly dependent upon artificial tranquilizers for comfort as any child with his favorite blanket. What matters is the telling of this sleep story. What matters is that I don’t keep what I saw to myself and pridefully let the strain of keeping it a secret rot my insides and emaciate my conscience until I start denying that it ever happened. What matters is that we take pride in our collective heritage of insomnia, and recognize our resistance to sleep as an impulse against death and towards life, as if the history of every society’s struggle against its own demise were being recapitulated every time we close our eyes. This is what distinguishes us from the birds and the cows that land and lay down in the face of extinction.\r\n\r\nAs I finish typing this story, there is a pleasant drowsiness tugging at my eyes. I hope that as I fall asleep tonight, no matter how drugged or drunk or distracted I am, I will try and feel myself sink into it, fighting all the time while knowing I am, like everyone, destined to lose. I hope my sleep is long and restoring, and that I lift myself up in the morning like a wiser, stronger generation, knowing the enemy better and ready to face it in the light of the new day.', '', 'horror', 1, 1, 0, '{}', '2022-06-10 11:11:28', 2, 0),

(8, 10, 'The Hooded Stranger', '\"Are you sure you\'ll be okay by yourself Mom?\" twelve year old Mitchell said as he tossed the oversized black duffel bag into the bed of his Dad\'s truck. \r\n\r\n\"Mitchell, I\'m 42 years old. If I\'m not okay by myself for three days at my age, something is really wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awe, Mom,\" fourteen year old Matthew said as he leaned down to kiss my cheek, \"We know you\'ll be okay but we can worry about you anyway.\"\r\n\r\nMy husband Justin walked out the door in his usual hurried manner when he\'s preparing to leave for a trip. \"What are you boys waiting on? Get in the truck. And where\'s Mark?\"\r\n\r\n\"Last time I saw him he was talking some mushy stuff to someone on the phone,\" Mitchell said as he rolled his eyes. \r\n\r\n\"Oh hell,\" Justin murmured beneath his breath, \"if he\'s going to be that way the whole trip, we might as well leave him here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\'m coming,\" sixteen year old Mark said as he walked out the door, \"I just had to tell someone goodbye.\"\r\n\r\nMitchell and Matthew rolled their eyes in unison. \r\n\r\n\"Tell Mom bye. It\'s time to go,\" Justin said. Then he leaned down and whispered in my ear, \"I love you,\" followed by a quick kiss. \r\n\r\nThe boys mumbled various words of farewell as they jumped in the truck to begin the argument over whose music to listen to first. \r\n\r\nAs I watched the dust whirl behind the black pick up truck, I took a deep breath. Finally a moment for myself. \r\n\r\nThe truck was barely out of sight when I heard a noise. A loud, whiny meow coming from somewhere in the trees on the side of the house. \r\n\r\nThen I saw it out of the corner of my eye. He, or maybe she, was dark gray or maybe black, but definitely one of the fattest cats I could ever remember seeing before. He was sitting on a high branch of a pine tree as my Labrador retriever Lucy circled the tree below. \r\n\r\nMy first instinct was to call Justin or the boys, but I had just promised them I would be okay. Surely one fat kitty hanging on a branch wasn\'t a need for alarm. \r\n\r\nJust as I\'d convinced myself to go inside and ignore the coming attack, a hooded figure peeked around the oversized oak tree in the corner of the yard. I blinked my eyes really hard, hoping it was just my imagination but when I opened my eyes....the hooded figure had moved behind another tree even closer. A pale, bony hand rested against the trunk. \r\n\r\nMy body froze. I held my breath. Had someone been watching my family pack up and leave this morning? Where was the gun Justin kept? Maybe I could just run next door. Oh hell, I\'m barefoot. I can\'t run anywhere. I picked up my phone, but never took my eyes off the hooded figure in the distance. I moved my thumb to tap the contacts icon, but just as I shifted my eyes to the phone screen, Lucy howled at the top of her lungs. I jumped so fast I knocked the ceramic cup full of warm coffee onto the porch. The cup busted into a million pieces and coffee splattered over everything. A piece of ceramic bounced off my foot and sliced the skin open. Bright red blood oozed down the side of my foot and mixed with the puddle of coffee. \r\n\r\nI didn\'t know if I wanted to cry or scream. The commotion interrupted Lucy\'s kitty cat stalking. She arrived at my feet licking the spilled coffee from the concrete. \r\n\r\n\"No, Lucy! You\'re going to cut yourself. Get out of that!\" As I yelled at Lucy, I looked up and the hooded figure was nowhere to be seen. I made a mad dash for the front door and Lucy followed. I locked the door behind myself, jiggling the knob before I walked away, just to be sure. \r\n\r\n\"Come on Lucy. Let\'s get my foot cleaned up, then we\'ll go back outside and clean up that mess.\" Lucy wagged her tail as if she understood exactly what I was telling her. \r\n\r\nIn the bathroom, I sat on the edge of the tub and let warm water run over my calves and feet. My heart pounded as I thought about the hooded visitor in the front yard.\r\n\r\nWho was it? What did they want? \r\n\r\nAfter applying a little antibiotic cream and a bandaid to the cut, I went to the kitchen and gathered paper towels, a broom and dustpan. If I didn\'t get the mess outside cleaned up, armies of hungry ants would invade the porch within a few hours. \r\n\r\nArmed with the tools I needed for the clean up, I called to Lucy to follow me back out to the porch. I sure wasn\'t going back out there all alone. When I stepped outside, the hooded figure with bony hands was knelt down next to my rocking chair picking up broken ceramic. \r\n\r\nLucy growled. \r\n\r\n\"Just what do you think you\'re doing?\" I squeaked out in confusion and fear. \r\n\r\nThe hooded figure never flinched. It slowly lifted its head. Dark brown sad eyes gazed back at me. I immediately recognized my hooded visitor as Ms. Hazel Oliver from down the street. The boys insisted Hazel was nothing short of an evil witch. The neighborhood stories included everything from Hazel chanting around candles in her yard at midnight to eating dogs and children. I\'d only seen her a handful of times in the fifteen years we\'d lived in this house, but she had a look about her a person can\'t quickly forget. \r\n\r\nHer skin was the palest I\'d seen on anyone in my life. Her hollow brown eyes were surrounded with dark gray circles. Her stringy salt and pepper hair fell half way down her back. She had thin lips and a pointy nose with a wart on the tip. She was rather slender but it was hard to tell since she was always dressed in loose fit black clothing. No matter the season, Hazel always wore the same black jacket. She was definitely one of a kind. Someone you will always remember. \r\n\r\n\"Whose blood is this?\" She asked as her eyes fell to my feet. \r\n\r\n\"I asked you a question first,\" I demanded as I held a growling Lucy by her collar. \r\n\r\n\"I scared you, so I\'m helping clean up the mess you made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why were you in my yard in the first place?\"\r\n\r\n\"To get Nox before that evil creature of yours killed him,\" Hazel whispered as she pointed a long pale bony finger at Lucy. \r\n\r\nLucy growled louder. \r\n\r\n\"Lucy isn\'t evil. Is Nox your cat in the tree?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That\'s his name. Now bring me that broom.\"\r\n\r\nI slowly walked toward Hazel, but held on to Lucy\'s collar with my free hand. Lucy had never attacked anyone, but she seemed quite upset by Hazel\'s presence in her territory. \r\n\r\nWhen I\'d gotten within a few feet of Hazel, I held out the broom. Hazel dropped the large pieces of broken ceramic into the dust pan and swept the small pieces onto it as well. When she finished, she reached for the paper towels I still held. She knelt down and dried the concrete, as I stood by holding onto Lucy. \r\n\r\n\"There,\" she said as she wadded the papertowls into a ball and dropped them onto the dustpan too, \"It looks like nothing ever happened here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" I managed to mumble. \r\n\r\n\"Now to get Nox out of the tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can\'t you just cast a spell?\" I blurted out without even thinking. \r\n\r\n\"A spell?\" Hazel laughed with a hint of sarcasm in her voice, \"What makes you think I can cast a spell? You don\'t believe those kids that I\'m a witch, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don\'t know. I\'m sorry I said that. So how will you get her down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have a ladder?\" \r\n\r\n\"I think we have one in the shed, but you aren\'t going to climb a ladder.\"\r\n\r\n\"And just why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I just don\'t think it would be safe.....\" my voice trailed off, I just couldn\'t tell her I thought she was too old to do such things but I guess she read my mind. \r\n\r\n\"I don\'t know how old you think I am, but I assure you I can climb a ladder.\"\r\n\r\nI started to argue with her, but I bit my lip instead. I slowly released my grip from Lucy\'s collar. There was no way to carry the ladder and hold onto Lucy at the same time. She had at least stopped growling. \r\n\r\nLucy surprised me. She slowly circled around Hazel\'s feet then stopped to sniff. She seemed calm enough for me to slip away and retrieve the ladder. She licked at the concrete where the coffee had landed earlier as I made my way to the shed.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned with the ladder, Hazel and Lucy were together beneath the tall pine tree where Nox held on for dear life. I stood the ladder as closely to the tree as possible. I still wasn\'t sure about Hazel climbing it though. All I could imagine was having to call Justin and the boys to announce that the witch from down the street had fallen off the ladder into our yard. \r\n\r\n\"I\'ll climb the ladder,\" I announced once I had it positioned. \r\n\r\n\"Nox won\'t come to you. There\'s no sense in trying.\"\r\n\r\nLucy barked as if she agreed with Hazel, so I gave in and watched Hazel slowly climb to the top. \r\n\r\n\"You be careful. Don\'t hurt yourself \"\r\n\r\n\"You sound like my dear Andrew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Andrew your son?\"\r\n\r\nHazel smiled. I\'d never seen her smile before.\r\n\r\n\"Andrew is my husband... or was. He\'s been gone fifteen years now,\" she said as her face dropped back to its usual sad state, \" We never had children.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\'m sorry,\" I muttered. \r\n\r\n\"It\'s okay. I have Nox. He keeps me company. He\'s all I have now.\"\r\n\r\nHazel turned her head back towards Nox, who seemed to hang on for his life not far above her head. Nox let out a soft meow. Lucy immediately began jumping around, wagging her tail and barking. She got so excited she bumped into the ladder. The ladder shifted and rocked causing Hazel to hang on while I grabbed it to hold it steady again. \r\n\r\n\"Oh goodness,\" I exclaimed, \"Hazel, please hurry and get off this thing before the next thing I have to do is call for an ambulance.\"\r\n\r\nHazel laughed. She reached out with one hand and she held on with the other. \r\n\r\n\"Come on now Nox, I\'m ready to go home.\"\r\n\r\nNox slowly crept down towards Hazel. I held on to the ladder and stared at Lucy, daring her with my eyes to even come near. \r\n\r\nHazel finally got Nox. I let go of the ladder to grab Lucy so Hazel could come down. Lucy growled but she stayed away from the ladder long enough for Hazel to finally get back to the ground. \r\n\r\nI breathed a sigh of relief, \"That was too much excitement for me in one day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for helping me getting Nox,\" Hazel said as she held her baby, \"We should head home and get some rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"No problem. I need to put the ladder back up and get some rest myself \"\r\n\r\n\"I\'ll be going now. Make sure to tell the boys that the old lady down the street isn\'t a witch after all,\" Hazel said with a smile. \r\n\r\n\"I\'ll be sure to let them know.\"\r\n\r\nAs Hazel began strolling away, I turned to get the ladder but it was gone. \r\n\r\n\"Hey Hazel, \" I called out, \"The ladder is gone.\"', '\"Are you sure you\'ll be okay by yourself Mom?\" twelve year old Mitchell said as he tossed the oversized black duffel bag into the bed of his Dad\'s truck. \r\n\r\n\"Mitchell, I\'m 42 years old.

(9, 12, 'Song of the Forest', 'According to the lore, Humans cannot experience the music of the forest.\r\n\r\nAt least, that’s what I’ve always been told. They are a species of just five senses, and even those have limitations; colors appear muted, sounds fall flat. Apparently, their hearing abilities are so atrophied they can only discern one distinct voice in a bird’s song, completely missing the three-part harmony of its chirped tune. It is clear they lack the sense of perception; I’ve seen it. I have watched the humans interact with almost no acknowledgement of one another’s feelings, as if they are entirely blind to the syrupy clouds of color formed by emotion.\r\n\r\nTaste must be affected too, or else they’d never leave the forest, where even the moist air lights the tongue like sweet nectar. But the music—I often wonder if they’d tread differently in our woods if they could hear it. It’s overwhelming at times, the sound of a million trees and insects and plants all emitting their unique chiming vibrations into time and space. The ancient oaks resonate their deep, low moan, the stream bubbles its crisp tenor. Dew drops sing in liquid whispers, and vibrant green ferns pulsate their erratic staccato, layering our song in anticipation.\r\n\r\nBut under every rock, and plant, and fungus, spanning the endless underground, are the mycelium with their spidery threads connecting all forest life; their ultrasonic hum is easily the most beautiful sound in the universe. Their voice establishes the key in which we all sing.\r\n\r\nMy wings brush against each other in a lyrical swish, feather against feather. My kind has thrived in these forests—in nature—since the beginning of time, but the human mind is unable to comprehend our existence and so my species remains unseen—invisible through the ages. Legend indicates we once co-existed, but in the humans’ thirst for transcendence, they advanced, scanning the stars for the secrets of the universe, then bowing to mathematics with her cold logic. And when they fell in worship at the feet of science’s unyielding laws, they abandoned the pursuits of the spirit realm, losing all connection to those peripheral, ethereal senses.\r\n\r\nIn their frenzied striving for omniscience, they’d unknowingly severed a limb, blinded one eye to an entire world they were in, but no longer of. Now, they look at us and see only what makes sense—maybe an exotic moth or butterfly, but never the truth.\r\n\r\nNestled under a red-capped Amanita muscaria, I awake to the breathy sighs of infant fronds unfurling from their curled dormancy. Sunlight trickles between the trees and warms the new life as they join our song with airy, wobbly voices. A doe and her young fawn pad across the mossy forest floor, their brassy huffs wafting in the air. They stop short and jerk their heads up, silent, ears twitching, before they bolt beyond the trees in a flash of brown and white fur. I place my ear to the ground, where the mycelium hum and squeal at the pressure from an above ground visitor, somewhere beyond the stream. I flit above the bushy sedges and birch tree saplings where I see something—someone teetering toward me. A human. A small, squishy human.\r\n\r\nHer wild sprigs of hair shudder like leaves in the wind and her skin is as smooth as a river stone. A cloud of pale-pink hovers over her body—curiosity, innocence. She wavers on the uneven ground, plump limbs bouncing with each step. She squats and rubs a patch of moss like a house pet. Its purr is like glass bells. The human laughs, a trickling, lilting giggle. She plucks a petal from a dainty white flower, and it gasps. The human’s eyes grow larger, and she stumbles. Her aura shifts from pink to a murky gray—uncertainty, confusion. She bends her ear to the maimed plant and listens, listens.\r\n\r\nHumans have traipsed and tromped though these woods for as long as I can remember, since my emergence—the day I poked and cracked my way out of that lucent chrysalis. Many wanderers have entered these woods; some are fearful, but most are searching. They are a restless species, cognizant of the void, yearning for wholeness in a grayscale world of their own design. The spirit realm whispers and pulls with its siren song, but they do not hear. Cannot hear. At least, that’s what I’ve always been told.\r\n\r\nThis sprite of a child suggests otherwise. My hands scrape against lichen on the trunk of a monolithic redwood tree as I cling, watching. If she can hear, could she see? See me? As I have done a thousand times before, I spring from the safety of the trees and chart an intersecting path with the human. I encircle her crown of curls and she turns in a staggering arc, following my flight, dewy eyes locked with mine. Her dimpled hand rises, reaching, pointing, and a sound like the crystalline chiming of the Trillium flower escapes her lips when she speaks.\r\n\r\n“Baby!”\r\n\r\nI sputter and crash into a narrow branch, scratching my delicate cheek. Though centuries older than this child, it is natural that a human might describe my diminutive features as infant-esque, though until now, that was only conjecture. The girl leans into the brush where I’ve fallen, her head tilted—watching, waiting. She claps and coos when I rise, then loses her balance and plunks onto the ground near a cluster of golden mushrooms.\r\n\r\nShe does not flinch when I flutter closer, just a heartbeat away from her pert nose. I lift one hand, she lifts one finger, and we touch—two species, two worlds, connected like searching tendrils. The mushrooms below us radiate a hollow, smooth timbre, cloaking the moment in somber warmth. My wings tingle in a rush of excitement. I fly down and rest my head near the mushrooms’ spongey caps and urge the child to do the same, pointing to my ear. She lumbers onto unsteady arms and lowers herself, ear crooning toward the strumming fungi. Moisture gathers on her unparted lips.\r\n\r\nI flit away, and hover near a beetle skuttling over strips of bark. I point to my ear again and she leans in, listening. The beetle’s song is metallic, bright, notes coming in short bursts. The girl laughs and I find myself laughing with her; beetles do make quite a jaunty noise. I have never known a silent world, a world without music, but I hear each sound almost as if for the first time as I share it with the small human—this anomaly of her species. I descend, below the exuberant foliage and plant my feet against the cool, damp earth. I point to the ground and lay down, ear to dirt.\r\n\r\nThe child mimics my actions and sprawls out along the forest floor, ear to earth. The mycelium’s hum is high and clear, like wind against glassy snowflakes. Their silvery song stretches for miles in the rich soil, an underground celestial choir. The girl is still as stone, unmoving but for her lips, which tremble. Her voice is honey, smooth and mellow as she matches the pitch of the ethereal hum, singing. The music of the forest is more beautiful than ever. Her aura is azure—a rare, dazzling blue, the color of wonder, magic. Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe mycelium squeal, their steady song dipping and shuddering. Footsteps, frantic and heavy, shake the forest; someone is running. I peer above a fallen tree to see a woman racing over the uneven ground, stomping grass and moss underfoot. The cloud of color above her swirls from orange to scarlet—fear, distress, panic. Her wild heartbeat sluices, like iron in water. She stops and turns in halting half circles, searching, calling. At the sound, the child lifts her head from the damp ground.\r\n\r\n“Mama.”\r\n\r\nDried leaves dangle from her hair when she rises on unsteady feet. Our eyes meet, two worlds, being pulled apart like roots from the earth. Her plump hand wiggles. Goodbye. She turns and rushes toward the woman, stumbling over thick growth. A rainbow of emotion explodes above the woman when she sees the child, shades of joy, relief, guilt. Love. When they embrace, a veil of rare, dazzling blue shrouds them.\r\n\r\nSpirit.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely I will ever encounter the child again, but I wonder, when she has grown and assimilated into her g', 'According to the lore, Humans cannot experience the music of the forest.\r\n\r\nAt least, that’s what I’ve always been told. They are a species of just five senses, and even those have limitations; colors appear muted, sounds fall flat. Apparently, their hearing abilities are so atrophied they can only discern one distinct voice in a bird’s song, completely missing the three-part harmony of its chirped tune. It is clear they lack the sense of perception; I’ve seen it. I have watched the humans interact with almost no acknowledgement of one another’s feelings, as if they are entirely blind to the syrupy clouds of color formed by emotion.', 'fantasy', 1, 1, 0, '{}', '2022-06-19 13:58:42', 1, 0),
(10, 11, 'The Accident', 'Mrs. Sally Crawford lived on her own in a house in Swansea. Her husband had recently passed away. Her children were all married and living far away. One day, when she was collecting her pension, Sharon, a very nice lady at the post office, said she was terribly sorry to hear about Mr Crawford. Sally replied that she was \'keeping going\', yet contemplating selling her house and buying a flat as the housework was getting too much for her. Sharon said \"Ever thought of having a home-help worker? My friend had one and he was really nice\". She went on : “He enjoyed the work, knowing he was getting it all nicely done and out of the way. He cared about the elderly lady and they occasionally went to the pub around the corner for a couple of nice jars. Have a think about it\". Sally said the she refuses to have a home-help worker as she prefers to do the housework on her own. Sally got her shopping done and decided to stop at the pub for her usual vodka and tonic. She got her shopping back to her house, tripping over a small vase which must have fallen from her small, hallway table. Sally landed on the kitchen floor. She was unconscious. The next morning, the postman became worried. He could sense something was wrong. Sally was usually pottering about in her garden at this time. He asked the next-door-neighbour, Mavis, for the key to Sally\'s modest terrace house. He found Sally in a heap on her kitchen floor. He phoned for an ambulance, not moving Sally for fear of making matters worse. Her breathing was very shallow. The ambulance arrived within minutes. Sally was rushed to hospital, while being resuscitated by the ambulance crew. They also found that her wrist had broken during the fall. The postman picked up her shopping from the kitchen floor, carefully putting the items in the cupboards and Sally\'s post on the coffee table in her front room. He then double-locked her front door and returned the keys to her neighbour. At about lunchtime the next day, Mavis brought some grapes, a nighty and slippers to Sally in hospital, asking her for a list of any other items required. Sally was extremely pleased at this, but was not her usual self. She looked pale and a little bit worn. The ward was very quiet, save for the occasional interruption by another patient calling out \"I\'m going for my pint now\", as she was gently ushered back to her cubicle by the kindly nurse. \"We need you here for another day, Mrs Croxley\", said the nurse. \"You\'re all out to get me\", was the reply. \"we\'re doing it for your own good, Mr Croxley - no one is out to get you\". Sally returned home a week later. She looked very happy, as if the accident never occurred! The End.\r\n', 'Mrs. Sally Crawford lived on her own in a house in Swansea.

(11, 15, 'The Everlasting Flame', 'Amenaous entered the sacred hold, lowering his hood. The light highlighted his young features, making his freckles glow like embers. The Flame flickered.Surely, it is a trick on my eyes. The Flame flicked again. He shook his head. The Flame was still brightly aglow.

The Flame provides heat and growth for the planet, giving it life and prosperity. As FlameBearers, our job is to watch the EverBurning Candle and keep it safe.

His master turned around. His robe, a dark amber in The Flame’s basking light.\r\n\r\n“Luckily, student, that is not a thing that can happen” the aged man croaked. A dark feeling fell into the pit of Amenaous’ stomach.\r\n\r\n“But Master-” he stuttered.\r\n\r\n“Student, you are not defying my wisdom, correct?” The Master lowered his hood, the light shadowed the deeper wrinkles in his face. Centuries of wisdom sparked in his eyes. Amenaous felt shame rise and glow in his cheeks. He solemnly shook his head. \r\n\r\n“Good,” his Master said. The Master left through the cave’s mouth. Amenaous stayed behind staring at The Flame. But what would happen if The Flame that had been prophesied for a thousand years was to go out? He slipped his hood back on as it sloped into his view. He let his eyes recover from the newfound darkness. He glances past The Candle at their painted insignia, a golden tongue of fire. The light in the dim cave blinked. His eyes flashed to The Flame. No, he thought, Master would not be wrong, he could not. Everything is perfectly fine. He departed from the cave, coming into the cavern that was filled with tents and hooded figures, their voices were like electricity. \r\n\r\nAmenaous avoided their gaze and looked at his worn-out boots. He counted their clumsy stitches as he walked. He knew what he saw. The disastrous consequences for him and the whole planet if he were right…if he were wrong. If he were wrong, he could be shunned from this civilization for making a mockery of their life’s work. Never to be allowed to the surface in case he felt the need to speak of their mission here. There was a large tent, a tent bigger than all the others with their sacred seal on the top. It’s velvet fabric frayed at the edges. The Grand Master. Amenaous swallowed the bile rising in his throat and entered the tent, uninvited.\r\n\r\n“What is the meaning of this?!?!” The Grand Master bellowed. Amenaous’ Master lowered his hood and stared at his student. Don’t do this, his eyes pleaded, this will only end poorly, no matter what you saw. Amenaous took a breath and looked into the shadowed eyes of The Grand Master and spoke.\r\n\r\n“Grand Master, The Flame flickered. I fear it could be extinguished.” The people in the tent looked at him. A cacophony of scoffs and laughter flooded his ears. Humiliation filled his senses. He gripped the sides of his cloak until his knuckles turned white.\r\n\r\n“Child, The Flame has been saved from eons or longer. Why now, pray tell, would it flicker?” The Grand Master mused. Amenaous stood with his feet rooted to the soil that once allowed him to walk freely.\r\n\r\n“It could go out. The Flame, I mean. The world could be wiped away.” he stammered.  Amenaous silently hoped that this truly was all in his head, that he was asleep and dreaming.  The Grand Master walked toward him and lowered his own hood. Faded ancient eyes looked at Amenaous.\r\n\r\n“Boy… You must not concern yourself with matters that are out of your hands,” The Grand Master hissed. “You are a scholar, a student! You have barely endured all the trials a Master must make. You know not what you say.”  Amenaous nodded and turned to leave the tent. His footsteps were slow and careful. He questioned the power of The Flame. If those who were sworn to protect it did not sense the urgency in this matter, then what is the point?\r\n\r\nHe entered the sacred hold. It seemed brighter this time. Hotter. Amenaous took off his cloak, instantly drenched with sweat. He approached The Flame. His breathing became labored. He was right up with the EverBuning Candle.\r\n\r\n“What trouble such a trivial looking thing can cause.” He whispered. The Flame danced in and out of consciousness. Amenaous felt worry and fear build up in his chest. He felt panic rise in him, smothering his breath. He must let it out. He releases a relaxing sigh. Then the heat and the light left, leaving the cave cold and dark. The world began to shake and crumble. \r\n\r\nThe Flame was out.\r\n\r\nA flood of panicked voices saturated the air. Amenous ran out of the cave to find his whole world was now in ruins. People tried to run as the ground continued shaking. Tents are being trampled and lamps overturned ablaze. The Grand Master made his way among them.\r\n\r\n“Friends, we must make our escape to the over-land, for we shall be safe, if for a little while.” He breathed. Amenaous watched his people fall into methodical rhythm and headed through the cavern to the place where the light would blind them. The Grand Master locked eyes with him through the crowd. The old teacher looked away, embarrassment passed over his features. \r\n\r\nAmenaous ran, weaving between the panicking people toward the surface. He covered his eyes, momentarily blinded by the strange sensation of sunlight. As he adjusted, he felt the warmth of the above land and the crispness of the air. \r\n\r\nBut his joy was soon ruined when he began to smell the plentiful fires and the destroyed landscape.\r\n\r\nThere would never be a way to fix this decaying world.', 'Amenaous entered the sacred hold, lowering his hood.

(12, 17, 'Wisdom of the Gods', '  The light from the fire at the end of the torch flickered along the cave walls. A young archaeologist cautiously made her way deeper into the cave. She was convinced she was on the right track to the greatest discovery in history. For her entire career, Isendra had searched for a lost civilization known as the Dracanae. The legends had mystified scientists and intrigued the masses but no one knew if it was real or just a story. Brief accounts had been found but no real hard evidence. No one had even found artifacts that the Dracanae Empire ever existed. Isendra never gave up the search. Something inside told her that the Dracanae Empire had in fact existed and were far more advanced than even modern humans. She had suffered much in her career from ridicule and no one wanted to take her theories seriously. They called them childish fantasies and regulated her to the fringes of the Archeological community. They took every opportunity to discredit the young archaeologist.\r\n\r\nThe only sounds in the cave were Isendra\'s boots on the dirt floor. The ground crunching beneath her feet. The sound echoed off the stone walls. After several minutes of walking, Isendra noticed familiar markings along the walls. She stepped closer and could see the symbols clearer. Many of the carvings were weathered and hard to read. But she had no doubts this was the first proof of the Dracanae Empire. Isendra became very excited. She took out her camera and snapped several pictures of the symbols on the cave walls. When she was sure that she had captured everything, Isendra continued through the cave. The symbols increased and became more pronounced. Isendra snapped more pictures, documenting everything she could. These pictures would prove she was not crazy and all who had ridiculed her would have to see it. They would have to rethink their own theories.\r\n\r\nThe cave opened up to an opulent temple. Isendra was amazed at the find. The preservation was impeccable. The walls were still covered in vibrant colors, the symbols looked as if they had just been carved the day before. The statues that stood around the room had no evidence of decay. Isendra could not believe the condition of the temple. This was the greatest discovery since King Tutankhamun\'s tomb. This would re-write history and call into question every theory attributed to the Dracanae Empire. Isendra was the first person to step on the white marble floors of this temple in millennia. A discovery like this would be life changing. Isendra knew the world would want to know everything that she discovered and everything about the legends that were once thought to be fairytales and fanciful musings. Isendra would be able to leave behind all doubt about her career choice.\r\n\r\nIsendra lost herself in thought and wonder as she wandered through the temple. Everything she had dreamed about her entire life was right there in front of her. Everything looked exactly as she had dreamed night after night. Isendra marveled at the colors on the walls and the condition of the perfectly carved statues. She felt as though she had just stepped through a portal to the past. Isendra could almost feel the people that once walked through these halls. She felt like she would round a corner and find one of the ancients crossing the marble floors. Then someone suddenly bumped into her from behind. The temple seemed to have all of a sudden filled with people. Their wooden sandals clicked on the stone floor and their gossamer robes slid lightly across the polished marble under their feet. Isendra turned to see who had run into her. She faced a very confused guard in ancient scale decorated armor. She blinked and the sounds and the people disappeared. Isendra was once again alone. Her torch was the only source of light illuminating the room. She looked around, blinking rapidly, confused about what she had just seen and heard. No matter what she did, the people did not return. Isendra shook her head and proceeded deeper into the temple.\r\n\r\nShe turned a corner and came face to face with a set of excessively large stone doors. They had a dragon with a giant egg carved in their face. There were jewels of red and purple set along the bottom and in the crown that sat upon the head of the dragon. The door was covered in gold and silver.\r\n\r\nIsendra wondered what could be behind these beautiful doors. Was it the lost tomb of the legendary warrior Queen of the Dracanae Empire? Maybe it was the inner sanctum dedicated to the Gods. One day she would find out. For now, she had to document this place. Isendra set her ruck sack down and took out the rest of her camera equipment. She set up the camcorder to record her discovering the temple. As the camcorder rolled, Isendra took the still camera and took up close pictures of everything in the temple. She also wrote in her journals; her thoughts on the discoveries and translations of the symbols on the walls. As time wore on, Isendra started to feel tired. She didn’t want to leave. She was afraid she would never find this place again or that she was dreaming. Isendra felt she had better just camp in the temple. She made her way back through the halls to the main room at the center of the temple. Isendra set up her small camp. She took out her small burner for a fire, she rolled out her sleeping bag and took out her food. Isendra put a couple of sausages on a roasting stick and held them in the fire. She waited until they were fully cooked. She pulled them out of the flames and placed them between two slices of bread. Isendra finished her meal and cleaned up. She turned the burner down and crawled into her sleeping bag. Before closing her eyes, Isendra prayed that she wasn’t dreaming and to wake up in this temple.\r\n\r\nIsendra closed her eyes and found herself in the temple walking with the priestesses, surrounded by guards. She watched as rituals of bounty and protection were performed. She bowed with the rest when the Queen entered. Isendra could feel the light gossamer gown that clung to her body. She had had similar dreams before but none had felt so real. She felt as though she was really living in the days of the ancients. \r\n\r\nA loud thud from a distance, pulls Isendra from her dream. She woke with a start and hurried to relight her touch. Once it was lit, she jumped up to search for the source of the sound. She took the roasting stick as a weapon, just in case. Isendra came upon the gold and silver door once again. This time they were wide open. She tentatively peered inside the room that had been hidden behind the doors.  \r\n\r\nInside, Isendra found a golden throne with a crown sitting in the seat. The crown was silver with red jewels encrusted around the brim. The golden throne was glowing. Isendra slowly stepped into the room and started to hear vocals like a choir. With every step closer she took, the singing was deafening. Being compelled by an unknown force, Isendra reached out her left hand and touched the arm of the opulent chair. The glow from the golden throne became so bright it hurt her eyes. She closed her eyes tight but could not remove her hand from the arm of the throne. It was as if it was being held down on the golden throne.\r\n\r\nSometime later, Isendra woke up on a soft bed. She could smell fresh lavender and roses. She opened her eyes and saw the golden posts of her bed and the white gossamer fabric that hung around the top of the bed, connecting the posts. The fabric moved with the gentle breeze. On the air the smell of the salty seas that Isendra was sure surrounded wherever she was. The cool breeze graced her body, that’s when she noticed that she was no longer wearing the khaki outfit that she had put on, the morning before starting her trek. Instead her body was clothed in a light, sheer material. It was the softest most comfortable fabric she had ever worn. She wondered what it was made out of. Her feet were bare beneath the gossamer sheet that also covered her body. Isendra came to her senses and lept out of the bed. She ran from the room and searched for information on where she was, how she got here, and who brought her here? As Isendra made her way through what appeared to be a palace, she passed guards and very confused servants. No one spoke to her or stopped her. That was until she came upon a set of opulent doors with two guards on either side. She tried to step toward the door but the guards put out their hands and stopped her. They spoke in a language that Isendra did not recognize. “I’m sorry, I don’t understand. Where am I?” she questioned. The guards just looked at her. It was obvious they didn’t understand what she was saying either. She threw her hands into the air in frustration. How would she ever find out where she was or how to get home? Then it hit her, maybe she could communicate in writing. She turned back to the guards, who looked at her with raised eyebrows. With rudimentary sign language, Isendra requested writing tools. The guards seemed to understand her request. One of them left the group. Isendra stood in silence and waited for the other guard to return. While she waited, Isendra studied the armor the woman wore. She noticed the intricate scale design and the dragon claw shoulder guards. She started to wonder if, somehow, she had ended up in the palace of the Warrior Queen of the Dracanae Empire. The guard returned with a tablet, a reed, and ink. Isendra smiled her thank you and took the tools. She knelt on the white marble floor and wrote out her questions in the symbols she had found in the temple walls. When she was finished, Isendra stood and handed the tablet to the guard. The armored woman took the tablet and read what was written. She held out her hand to request the reed and ink. Isendra handed them over and the guard wrote the responses. When the guard was finished she handed the tablet back. The young woman read it, with minor difficulties.:\r\n\r\n“You are in the Palace of Issea, Queen of the Dracanae Empire. You were found in the inner sanctum in the Temple of Draca. The Gods brought you to us. After you were found, you were brought here to the palace. Queen Issea will speak with you soon. You should return to your chambers and rest.”\r\n\r\nIsendra thought for a moment, then asked for the reed. On the tablet and wrote:\r\n\r\n           “I do not know where the chambers are. I did not take notice of the path.”\r\n\r\nThe guard read the tablet. She nodded with a smile and indicated she would show Isendra the way. The young woman allowed herself to be led back to the chambers she had woke in just moments earlier. Isendra walked in, turned to watch the guard close the door. She was starting to feel like a prisoner. She walked over and sat on the edge of the bed thinking. After a few moments, Isendra stood and walked towards the gossamer curtains along the wall. She opened them to reveal the large balcony. She stepped out into the sunlight. Isendra closed her eyes and took in a deep breath of fresh sea air. She opened her eyes and looked out upon the city outside the palace walls. Out past the city was the sparkling sea. The buildings of the cities had domed roofs with gray marble that almost looked silver in the sunlight. The sea looked like stars twinkling in the midday sun. Isendra felt like she was standing in the heaven she had been told about as a child. \r\n\r\nIsendra started to feel a peace wash over her that she had never felt before. Nothing bothered her, her worries dissipated. A serene smile spread across her porcelain face. The sea breeze gently tossed her long dark locks and she surrendered to the peace reaching into her soul. Isendra was so wrapped up in her own thoughts that she didn’t realize that someone had entered her chambers and was now standing behind her smiling.\r\n\r\nA tall, red haired regal woman stood at the entrance of the chambers facing the balcony. She watched as the newcomer embraced the breeze and took in the scents of the world. The tall woman watched as a weight was lifted from the shoulders of the young woman. The tall woman just stood there smiling at her. “Welcome home.” the tall woman finally spoke. Isendra gasped and turned to the source of the voice.\r\n\r\n“Who… Who are you?” she questioned. “I am Queen Issea of the Great Dracanae Empire. I am glad to see you have come home.” the tall woman replied with a wide smile and tears in her eyes. “What do you mean ‘Come Home’ ?” Isendra asked. Queen Issea stepped across the marble balcony towards the railing beside Isendra. She sighed and looked towards the horizon. “When you disappeared, I thought that I would never see you again. Hopes of a prosperous future faded into darkness. Then one night, the Gods gave me a sign. They had to take you. There were so many things that you needed to learn to serve your people. These lessons could not be learned anywhere in the Empire. I had to trust that the Gods had a plan and that I would see my beautiful princess again.” Queen Issea explained. Isendra did not understand what she was being told. The Queen could see that the young woman was not grasping the information. “Isendra, you are my daughter. You are the heir to the throne and the future of the Empire.” she revealed. “What?” Isendra’s eyes grew wide and confused.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t remember anything of your life here. You were so young. You were at the Temple with me during a ritual to ask the Gods for prosperity. You wondered off. Which is something you did often. You never could sit still. We searched, the entire Empire searched for you. A few days later I got the message from the Gods. and called off the search.” Queen Issea responded. Isendra thought for a moment without speaking. She thought back to her childhood. She remembered never staying in one place very long and how none of those places ever felt like home. She had always felt like she just didn’t belong. There were the dreams since she could remember about the temple and the Dracanae Empire. In her heat she knew it was all real, no matter how many times people told her it was all legends and dreams. She was told to grow up and focus her energy on the real world. But now she was standing in a palace with the Great warrior Queen. Now the queen was claiming Isendra was her very own daughter. This couldn’t be, she was dreaming. This kind of thing just didn’t happen.\r\n\r\n“How can you be sure I am really your daughter?” Isendra finally spoke. “I know this must seem impossible. I can prove it to you.” Queen Issea offered. Isendra nodded in agreement. Queen Issea nodded and led the young woman off the balcony and out of the chambers. They passed through the marble halls, followed by no less than ten guards. Isendra stayed silent as the group made their way through the palace. At the end of a long corridor they came upon a set of large stone doors that opened as they approached. The group walked through the doorway and entered a place familiar to Isendra. They had just entered the temple she had discovered in the cave. Queen Issea led the group into a room that Isendra had not seen when she was exploring the temple. The walls of the room were covered in paintings that looked like family life. The Queen stopped in front of one that looked like a mother and child. She pointed to an inscription underneath it. Isendra stepped closer and read the inscription.\r\n\r\n“On this day of glory, the God have blessed the Dracanae Empire. The future of the Empire rests in the strong hands of our Princess\r\n\r\nPrincess Isendra of the Dracanae Empire.\r\n\r\n                  May the Gods bless and keep her”\r\n\r\nIsendra looked at it stunned. She had wondered where her name had come from. She had never met another person with her name nor had she ever found it in any baby name book. But still this did not prove she was who the Queen claimed. “You seem to need more proof.” The Queen commented seeing the look on Isendra’s face. Queen Issea led them over to the bookshelves along the far wall. She removed scrolls. She placed her load on the table that was at the center of the room. Isendra looked through the scrolls and found a painting of a young child. It was ore realistic than that depicted on the walls. She looked at it closely and spotted a mark on the forehead of the child in the same spot, the same shape and color of the one on her forehead. She touched the spot on her head. “That is the mark of the Gods.” The queen said, turning around and lifted her hair. On the back of her neck was the same mark. \r\n\r\nThis was too much to take and Isendra ran from the room. The Queen let her go. Queen Issea was comforted by the fact that her child was home.', 'The light from the fire at the end of the torch flickered along the cave walls. A young archaeologist cautiously made her way deeper into the cave. She was convinced she was on the right track to the greatest discovery in history. For her entire career, Isendra had searched for a lost civilization known as the Dracanae. The legends had mystified scientists and intrigued the masses but no one knew if it was real or just a story. Brief accounts had been found but no real hard evidence. No one had even found artifacts that the Dracanae Empire ever existed. Isendra never gave up the search. Something inside told her that the Dracanae Empire had in fact existed and were far more advanced than even modern humans. She had suffered much in her career from ridicule and no one wanted to take her theories seriously. They called them childish fantasies and regulated her to the fringes of the Archeological community. They took every opportunity to discredit the young archaeologist.', 'fantasy', 1, 1, 0, '{}', '2022-06-19 14:03:02', 0, 0);

(13, 19, 'Princess in the Woods', 'Once upon a time, deep within the woods, there lived two princesses. One of them, Marie Heatherton, was a pretty eighteen-year-old girl, with long strawberry blonde hair that reached just past her lower back, and big brown eyes. \r\n\r\nShe wanted to experience a bit of independence before settling down with a prince from a nearby town, so her father decided to build her a mini castle about two or three miles away, deep within the safest part of the woods that surrounded their town. She promised to live there for no more than two months before returning back to her family’s castle.\r\n\r\nShe had everything a regular castle would have, as well as a few extra things she had always wanted: her own master bedroom with a big walk-in closet and an even bigger bathroom with a built-in sauna room.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was one thing her father somehow forgot to mention. She wasn’t living completely alone in the woods. She had a neighbor. Let’s go back about 2 days in the past.\r\n\r\nJuniper Weathersby was a beautiful princess who lived in the neighboring town a few miles away from Marie. The night of her nineteenth birthday, she waited until midnight to sneak out of her room and out of the castle for good. She wanted to run away from her family’s castle, having changed her mind about marrying the rich prince that her father had chosen for her without her knowing.\r\n\r\nShe gathered as many clothes and shoes as she could fit in her shoulder bag, as well as some toiletries, and tiptoed as quickly and as quietly as she could out of her room, down the hall, and down the large staircase out the castle front doors.\r\n\r\nShe raced deeper into the woods, still hopping with glee from her recent escape from her overbearing family. She stumbled upon a gorgeous two-story mini castle after about twenty minutes or so of walking around. What a lovely little castle, Juniper thought to herself. \r\n\r\nAt first, she was tempted to barge right on in and start living there, but she thought better of it and decided to keep walking and hope an empty cottage was nearby where she could live. \r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, she was right. An empty, slightly dilapidated cottage sat less than a mile away from the mini castle. After Juniper knocked several times on the door and circled the entire cottage twice, looking though each window thoroughly, she came to the conclusion that the cottage was abandoned and moved herself in right away.\r\n\r\nShe finally had her own space, far away from the snooping eyes of her mother and the stern gaze of her father. \r\n\r\nOkay, now that you’ve met the two princesses, we should go back to present day. It was June 3rd, otherwise known as Marie’s birthday. Had Marie stayed at home in her family’s castle, there would’ve been a huge dinner party with hundreds of guests and all of Marie’s favorite foods laid out on long tables. This wouldn’t be the case for her this year. Since she now lived on her own, she decided to sleep in for once. However, this wasn’t meant to be.\r\n\r\nShe shot upright in her bed, having heard a loud noise from somewhere deep within the woods. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes, then quickly stretched her arms and legs before jumping out of bed. She walked over to the huge window that faced the woods, peering out into the thick trees and bushes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the nearby cottage, Juniper was dancing wildly in the living room. Since she no longer had to abide to the strict “quiet time before 9am” rule that was put in place by her strict father, she decided to sing some of her favorite songs. \r\n\r\nShe sang at the top of her voice, but she wasn’t very good. The birds and other wildlife quickly fled from their perches near her cottage. She rocked her head swung her arms around herself, almost as if she were impersonating a beast of some kind. She didn’t really care whether or not anyone else could hear her. All that mattered in that moment was her moving body and her passionate singing.\r\n\r\nMarie thought she’d heard someone shouting something, but she couldn’t quite hear what they were saying. She quickly got dressed, grabbed her bag with her castle keys, and made her way outside. As soon as she opened the front door, she almost dropped her bag when she covered her ears as best she could. The shouting was much louder outside than inside her mini castle.\r\n\r\nHer mood instantly changed from mildly curious to annoyed. Her eyebrows furrowed, she kept her ears tightly plugged with the palms of her hands as she stomped her way towards the screeching sound. After several long minutes of stomping through the woods, she found herself directly in front of where the shouting was coming from, a small cream-colored cottage with lush moss on its roof.\r\n\r\nWho could possibly find it okay to shout this early in the morning? Marie thought to herself as she slowly made her way to the cottage’s front door. I’ve got to politely tell them to stop. It’s way too early for this.\r\n\r\nRight before Marie was about to knock on the door, it suddenly swung open. Juniper abruptly stopped singing when she noticed Marie standing right in front of her.\r\n\r\nThe two princesses stared at each other, their eyes as wide as possible, their mouths hanging open. After a full thirty seconds of staring, Marie broke the awkward silence first.\r\n\r\n“Hello there,” Marie stated, not forgetting the strict rules of common courtesy taught to her by her mother years ago. “My name is Marie, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would stop shouting so loudly.”\r\n\r\nJuniper took a few extra seconds to do a quick once-over of Marie before finally responding.\r\n\r\n“Name’s Juniper, and I wasn’t shouting,” replied Juniper, rolling her eyes. “I was singing. You oughta know the difference by now. You look old enough.”\r\n\r\nMarie sputtered, utterly shocked by Juniper’s blatant disrespect.\r\n\r\n“How dare you speak to me like that!” Marie announced, her courteous manner slipping away from her mind. “I am a princess of royal blood. What gives you the right to speak to me in such a rude manner?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care whether or not your blood’s royal or stupid,” Juniper retorted. “You’re on my private property, and I don’t like that. I’m going to go gather some food for myself. If you’re still here by the time I get back, then you certainly won’t like what I do to you later. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have places to be.”\r\n\r\nAnd with that, she slammed the front door shut as she brushed right past Marie, who stood there in absolute bewilderment. Juniper looked back only once, just to see what Marie would do next. Marie just stayed rooted at the spot, still reeling from the bold encounter. Juniper snickered to herself as she faced forward and strolled deep into the woods.\r\n\r\nMarie had no idea what to do next. She didn’t think she had a neighbor, let alone one as rude as Juniper. She was almost too scared of what would happen if she lingered close to Juniper’s cottage any longer. \r\n\r\nWith that thought in mind, she scurried off in the opposite direction of where Juniper walked off. Even though Marie had no idea where she was headed, she kept running, hoping to somehow find her way back to her mini castle home.\r\n\r\nAfter several minutes of running, Marie wound up at the edge of her hometown. Not wanting to turn back around and somehow get lost in the woods again, she quickly made her way back to her family’s castle. Once there, she sheepishly greeted the royal guards at the front gate, most of them quite shocked to see her again so soon. They opened the front doors for her, and she ran up the long staircase straight to her parents’ bedroom. \r\n\r\nHer parents were both very surprised and relieved to see her again. Her mother squeezed her tight in a hug, while her father gently stroked her hair. Her father gently asked her why she had returned so soon, but Marie was still too shocked by the previous encounter she experienced to give a clear answer. Instead, she declared that she was now ready to marry the prince from the nearby town. Elated, her parents busied themselves quickly with the wedding preparations.\r\n\r\nWhere was Juniper when all this happened, you ask? She was still deep in the woods, picking berries and collecting nuts for her dinner later that evening. After a few more hours of this, she waltzed back to her cottage, not at all surprised to see that Marie was long gone. Juniper smiled to herself as she entered her cottage, slamming the door shut behind her.', 'Once upon a time, deep within the woods, there lived two princesses.

(14, 21, '1869 Gehenna Street, Hades', 'The heat erupted from the very rocks themselves. With no sun, orange light emitted from the glowing stalactites that jutted from the roof of the massive cave like giant flaming lances. Pools of sulfuric acid smoked and gurgled, belching fumes that burned the nostrils; fumaroles were burping dragons releasing acrid gases. This was 1869 Gehenna Street, Hades, just up the way from the Abyss. The apartments were carved into solid rock by wayward souls that had yet to earn a chance to hurl themselves into the eternal fire and be erased from the afterlife. It was here that Richard resided. It was here that he had the unfortunate luck to share a wall with Chuck.\r\n\r\nRichard, a greater devil, heard the screams through the rock, followed by thumps and zinging. He reported Chuck to Mayor Mephistopheles last week for his infernal loudness.\r\n\r\n\"I already threw your guitar into the acid pit! I swear to Satan if you are learning the drums, I will be your worst nightmare!\" Richard beat his boot heel on the wall, he was positive lesser devils like Chuck were not allowed to own drum sets, but the sounds were eerily reminiscent of the heavy metal Richard played as a wee demon in party school.\r\n\r\nRichard went outside and banged on the door of Chuck\'s cave with a fist followed by his leathery forehead. “Knock it off!” The sounds stopped. The mail slot on the door slid open and two red irises glared out.\r\n\r\n“What.”\r\n\r\n“I can hear that through two feet of stone. You couldn\'t play \'When the Levee Breaks\' by Led Zeppelin if Jimmy Page himself cast a spell on you.”\r\n\r\n“I\'m not playing the drums. What drums? I was beat boxing. BOOM BOOM TICH BOOM BOOM BA TICH.” Chuck\'s oval pupils darted back and forth.\r\n\r\n“That\'s a lie. I\'m going to slowly beat you to death with your drum sticks if you don\'t tone it down.” Richard felt like poking two fingers into Chuck\'s shifty eyeballs. He couldn\'t rush in and catch him in the act, since the guitar incident Chuck locked his deadbolt. Richard picked up a chunk of rock and thought about throwing it at the door, but stopped and tucked it behind his back when he saw a beautiful woman approaching.\r\n\r\n“Hi, how\'s it going?” Richard\'s lines were terrible.\r\n\r\nThe buxom blonde nodded, her curls bouncing. She flashed a smile full of white teeth, corralled by ruby red lipstick. It froze Richard like a pubescent teenager. Jane Mansfield hadn\'t aged at all. Fortunately for everyone in Hell, she still looked like she did in 1967. He squinted, who was that running up to her? Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters and Sammy Davis Jr. were jogging up to the bombshell, tongues wagging like feral dogs chasing a bitch in heat.\r\n\r\nHe wanted desperately to know what they were talking about, Jane shifted on her high heels and laughed, putting a red gloved hand to her face. It looked like Sammy was doing his best impersonation of Groucho Marx. When Dave lit Sammy\'s cigar with the tip of his index finger, Richard rolled his eyes. He knew there was no way he could keep up with those two.\r\n\r\n“Hey! Dolly!\" The goth girl from three doors down pinched his elbow. Always settling was Richard. He was startled from his voyeuristic musings and reached out to shake her hand.\r\n\r\n“Just give me a hug you dummy.” Dolly wrapped her plump arms around his chest and squeezed. “Whatcha\' doin\' later? Randy, Candy and I are playing Tarot poker later if you want to come over. Candy is making her famous Bloody Marys.” The lilt in her voice made Vodka sound appealing.\r\n\r\n“Tarot poker?” Richard\'s face contorted.\r\n\r\n“It\'s just like five card stud only we use Tarot cards.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe. I\'m supposed to torture some souls later with Ozzy\'s son Jack. We make terrible music and watch them writhe and squirm. It\'s a real hoot. I\'m pretty sure we have some Fundamentalist Christians and a Muslim lined up.”\r\n\r\n“Well it\'s an open invite. If you get bored torturing stop by later. We are going to stay up late and watch The Witches of Eastwick.” Dolly gave Richard the fakest cheek smooch she could muster and flashed her black nail polish with a equally fake Hello Kitty tiny wave.\r\n\r\nRichard went back to his empty apartment. Since marriage was strictly forbidden in Hell, devils and demons were limited to one night stands and self pleasure. Even that didn\'t seem appealing at the moment. He decided to flip on the entertainment unit. After ten commercials, Richard muttered to himself, “I\'m in for some torture.”\r\n\r\n\'Keeping up with the Kardashians\' was on perpetual shuffle again. What is it Satan keeps telling us? Don\'t dish it out if you can\'t take it.\r\n\r\nRichard really wanted some sweets. His memory of his mom\'s fudge tunnel cake needled him some more. Eating was strictly prohibited in Hell, unless you wanted to chew on rocks. Last time they were hanging out, Jack Ozbourne said, \'My Dad told me, if you win the torture contest you can enter for a chance to eat a real live beating human heart.\' Yuck! Humans were so gross they probably tasted bad too.\r\n\r\nAfter four straight episodes of \'The Kardashians\' Richard couldn\'t take anymore. Flipping on the radio, 66.6 FM was blasting \'Who let the Dogs Out! WOOF WOOF WOOF WOOF\' He felt like screaming at the top of his lungs when he turned off the entertainment center and it was supplanted by a velvet painting of Miley Cyrus doing that tongue thing. Argh! Midnight couldn\'t come fast enough.\r\n\r\n“Hey! Open the door.” Jack\'s voice drifted into Richard\'s foggy subconscious. He had nodded off again. Sleeping was banned in Hell, but one could just nod off occasionally for some rest.\r\n\r\n“Jack, and look, It\'s Sharon! Oh joy!” Opening the door, Richard had a bad feeling about this. Sharon Ozbourne was an archdevil, she could milk a whole nights worth of bad music out of anybody. He was hoping for a few hours of soul torturing and then planned to stop by Dolly\'s apartment later. If Sharon was involved, she wouldn\'t be happy until at least one soul was tortured to death.\r\n\r\nThe walk to the Gates of Hell was ruined by Sharon\'s endless prattling. Jack kept agreeing with her which kept her going. \'Ozzy this and Ozzy that\'\r\n\r\n“You wouldn\'t have a career if it wasn\'t for your husband.” Richard mumbled it out loud while thinking about it.\r\n\r\n“What was that Richard? I saw your mouth moving but nothing intelligent was coming out.” Sharon perceived the slight and let it go.\r\n\r\nAt the Gates of Hell a giant opening in the roof of the cave went up for miles. The new denizens of Hell were lowered in a steel cage and made to wait while the lesser and greater devils tortured them for some time before they were let in.\r\n\r\n“Let\'s see....We have Michael Hanson. He molested dozens of children at the daycare where he was a youth pastor for years, had a massive stroke. Chelsey Cravens. She spent her young adult life getting teenagers hooked on heroin before overdosing on Fentanyl. Malik Mohammed. He blew himself up with a suicide vest and killed twelve children at a newly built grade school for girls.” Jack folded the cover sheet back on his notebook and looked to his mom.\r\n\r\n“Well is it pitchforks or pitchy renditions of cover songs from American Idol?” Sharon raised her eyebrows.\r\n\r\nRichard lifted his hand. “I vote pitchforks first. I haven\'t stabbed any child molesters in a few weeks.\" Jack and Richard took turns prodding the three in the cage with a red hot trident. The screaming and moaning stretched on for a half an hour, until their arms were tired. Sharon told Ozzy stories from the 1970\'s for the whole session, which made the poking seem bearable by comparison.\r\n\r\n“Are you ready?” The three cast offs of humanity hadn\'t even recovered when Sharon said, “O.K. Jack and Richard, I want you to sing Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen three times through, acapella.”\r\n\r\nThe pitchy, nasally, off key vocals of Richard and Jack caused the torturees to stick their fingers in their ears and scream to drown them out. The more they screamed the louder they sang, until both of them were out of breath.\r\n\r\n“You guys need a break. I\'ll put \'The Talk\' on fast forward in a continuous loop in their minds eye for a bit. Sherri Shepherd will wear them down, then maybe we can throw rocks at them for an hour.\" Sharon\'s plum blazer contrasted against the ochre walls of Hells ribcage, yet still matched her eye shadow.\r\n\r\nDuring the break, the torturers turned to politics.\r\n\r\n“Did you hear that Marilyn Manson is running against Anton LaVey for Governor of Hades?”\r\n\r\n“You\'re joking. He might have a chance. A lot of people in Hell like Manson,” Richard mused.\r\n\r\n“Come on, LaVey practically invented Satanism,” Jack favored the establishment.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but he can\'t get the youth vote, he\'s almost passe like Aleister Crowley. What if he ran with Charles Manson? A Manson Manson ticket would be a landslide victory at the ballot box.” Richard had a soft spot for progressives.\r\n\r\n“Alright now you\'re torturing me,” Sharon interrupted them. “Let\'s just stone them for an hour or so and then we can call it a night. Hmm?”\r\n\r\nPicking up rocks large enough to sting, Jack, Sharon and Richard pelted the lost souls in the cage as they cowered and shielded themselves with their arms. Sharon picked up sharp rocks, she had a thing for cutters. Jack and Richard were dudes, they just threw ones that felt good in the hand. After twenty minutes it was work and they quit.\r\n\r\nDone with torturing, Sharon led them back to Gehenna Street. The three were quiet for some time satisfied that they let their evil out.\r\n\r\n“You know Richard, mom wants me to get my own place. You need a roommate?”\r\n\r\n“Sorry Jack, I\'m a lone wolf. I am thinking about moving out of Hades to The Nether World though.”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do about your lease?” Jack was interested.\r\n\r\n“I\'m thinking about subletting the apartment until the lease is up,” Richard smiled.\r\n\r\n“How are the neighbors where you live.”\r\n\r\n“Oh they\'re great.” Lying came natural in Hell.\r\n\r\n“You hear that mom. Will you sign for me and pay my rent?” Jack\'s face lit up.\r\n\r\nSharon Ozbourne imagined lonely quiet nights with full glasses of wine on her couch. “Sure honey, anything for my wittle Boo.”\r\n\r\n“It\'s a deal Jack.” They shook hands. “You are going to hit it off with Chuck.”\r\n\r\n“Chuck, who\'s that?”\r\n\r\nRichard\'s face twisted in a mad grin. He pretended not to hear him.', 'The heat erupted from the very rocks themselves.

(16, 23, 'This Can\'t Be Real', 'Joey knew he shouldn\'t of went to the movie. He especially shouldn\'t went to see the one he saw. It was one of the scariest movies he had ever seen. At one point there was a scene that made him jump that he threw his popcorn over his head. Joey was so embarrassed, he scooted down in his chair. That did no good because his popcorn flew all over the couple two rolls behind him. The woman gave out a shriek and the guy yelled, \"hey man watch it\". Joey while scooting down, softly replied, \"sorry\". His girlfriend Elaine refused to come with him because he complained about how scared she got. He knew it was the complete opposite, it was him that got scared. Joey has always like scary movies involving the paranormal and monsters and crime. Even as a young child he would sneak and watch scary movies at night, His mother would protest because on more than one occasions, he\'d wake up screaming, “it’s not real!\" and his mother would run into his room to comfort him. He\'d been placed on punishment for the same thing several times. Joey\'s brothers and sisters would also snitch on him for staying up late watching movies he wasn\'t supposed to be watching. He\'d always said to himself when he grew up and was on his own, he\'d watch all the scary movies he wanted to. What he didn’t count on was he’d still be just as scared as an adult as he was as a child, but he was. This movie was different he thought. It felt like the spirit, the evil spirit in the movie was stuck in his head. He shook it off as he drove home because he knew it was silly. But he couldn’t help but think that even the title of the movie was creepy.  The movie was call “Devil Within”. Joey could only wonder within what? Joey’s mother would say those kinds of movies leave spirits in your house. Of course, Joey didn’t believe it then and he didn’t believe it now. He’s watch scary movies for most of his life and he’d never had anything unusual happen to him.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived home, he stepped out his car and directly to his left was sitting his neighbor’s black cat Chester. Chester was an unwelcome nuisance. He was always around. He would just sat and look at you. Joey had often wonder what Chester was thinking as he watched you intently. Joey thought as he walked toward his door with Chester behind him. He had never heard Chester make a sound, no purr, no meow, nothing. He thought how strange that was but for some reason on that night that unusual observation had crossed his mind. Is Chester mute? He put the key in the door and turned it. The door opened to the front part of his small apartment. Joey was lucky to find this small place and was grateful. He threw the keys on the table that all but filled the kitchen area. It took Joey about two seconds to realize the apartment was completely dark. He could have sworn he\'d left the bathroom lights on because he knew it would be dark when he came home. His bathroom had three studio lights that hung above the bathroom sink. He also had one that was in the ceiling. Each set of light had its own switch. One was right by the door and the other was just below the studio lights, that was the switch that controlled those. It was the studio lights he had left on. But they were off for some reason. It hadn’t stormed while he was at the movie so there hadn’t been a power outage. He didn\'t give much more thought. He figured he had forgotten.\r\n\r\n    Elaine would be by about ten, ten thirty, right after work. She had the next day off. Elaine was a college student working her way through school. They had plans to be married some day. The next day she wanted to use Joey’s apartment to study. He didn’t mine because he would be at work, so things would be quiet. Joey fixed himself a sandwich, seeing how his popcorn at the movie took flight. He was hungry. He set at the kitchen table with his sandwich and some bottled water. The next thing he saw drew goosebumps on his arm. His TV had come on for no apparent reason. He quickly turns towards it with his heart pumping. Joey couldn’t decided which scared him worse, the fact it came on in the first place or the volume.  Joey recognized the station it was on. It was the station it was always on, “Scary Seats”. It was all about scary movies of some kind. Joey set in his old recliner, given to him about a year ago by his father. Joey’s mother had purchased it for him for Father’s Day.\r\n\r\nJoey had over time broken it in to fit his body. It was his bed more so than his real bed itself. He slept like a baby while in this recliner. Joey relaxed in his chair and set his watch for one hour, enough time to get in a quick nap and enough time to get up and prepare for Elaine’s arrival. The flat screen showing the movie, “Satan’s Son”. Joey had seen this one before, so he didn’t fight his sleep to watch it. Joey couldn’t help to think about the lights, Chester and the movie he had just seen as he dozed off.\r\n\r\n    The next thing he recalled when he woke up was someone pounding on his door. He got up, opened the door and there stood a guy dressed in all black. He introduced himself as Chester Lived. He was polite enough Joey thought. He was looking to sell Joey some life insurance. Lived said he worked for Natas Insurance LLC. Joey for some reason felt uneasy and it had nothing to do with Lived’s cold hand he had shook, nor the fact he was wearing all black in the middle of summer, it was something about his smile. His smile showed teeth that did not meet, none of them. There was a gap between each one, top and bottom, or as many as Joey could see when Lived smiled. That was creepy as anything, but even his eyes looked out of sorts. They were black and showed no white. That should have prompted Joey to shut the door in his face, but he didn’t. Before Joey could say no I don’t need, Lived was standing in Joey’s living room, next to his recliner chair. It happened so fast Joey had to do a double take. Lived told Joey he noticed Joey was watching Satan’s Son. He reached out his hand again and told Joey, “It’s my pleasure to meet you”. Joey begins to back away from Lived. His heart was beating so hard and so loud. Lived begins, “I can heard your heart Joey”. “You’re not afraid of me, are you?” Joey begins to shake his head as if to shake it hard enough what he was witnessing would go away, wouldn’t be true.  “Who are you and what do you want?” Joey protested. “I’m here to offer you life insurance Joey\". \"You’re going to need it”. Lived insisted. “For what!?” Joey shouted. Lived looked at Joey with his black eyes and insisted, almost warning him to keep his voice down. “Joey you’re the one watching me and inviting me into your home, your heart and your soul.”  “I thought you wanted to meet me.” “Meet you for what?” Joey asked. “I don’t know Sir.” “You tell me”, Lived asked wondering. Joey turned away and continued again to back away from Lived and before he knew it he had tripped backwards over the foot stool. He hit his head on the end table knocking himself out cold.\r\n\r\n    Joey opened his eyes and there stood Elaine, calling his name. Joey started screaming and Elaine did too. “What’s wrong with you Joey, wake up!” Elaine shouted. Joey jumped to his feet with a slight stumble. He ran into the bathroom and looked in.  He ran to the door and looked outside. “What are you looking for, who are you looking for?” Elaine asked. “Lived”, Lived who?” They went back and forth. “Chester Lived” he replied. “The cat?”, she insisted, “No!” the man Chester Lived.”  Joey tried to explain as he paced back and forth rubbing his head. He would from time to time say ouch. Elaine made him sit on the edge of the recliner chair and looked at his head. “I don’t know if I want to know what in the world is going on with you but I kind of got an idea”.  Elaine said. Joey knew she knew. It was another one of those scary movies. “I told you one more and we were done!\" \"One more because they seem to take over your life and mines”, she screamed. “The last time you stated sleep walking and came at me with a knife trying to protect yourself against me”, she protested and \"I’m sick of it”. Elaine threw the towel she had been using to dap the blood off the bleeding lump on his head. Joey started apologizing vehemently and asking for forgiveness. “Joey we’re having a child together I can’t put our baby threw this”, she exclaimed. Elaine thinks Joey has an addiction to scary movies. She’s asked him to get help, but he insists that he doesn’t. It’s been this that has kept her from moving in. Joey admitted to himself he didn’t want her to because it would interfere with his watching the types of movies he likes. Elaine picked up her things and was on her way out the door. She told Joey she was done and when he made a decision to let her know. He didn\'t try to stop her. He knew he had to make a choice, was he willing to loose his girlfriend, future wife and child? They were movies. it was time to stop. He was lucky Elaine didn\'t leave him when he came after her with that knife. This time he knew there would be no cooling off period. He shut the door behind Elaine. He fell against the door in utter exhaustion, shook his head and mumbled to himself, \"this can\'t be real\".', 'Joey knew he shouldn\'t of went to the movie. He especially shouldn\'t went to see the one he saw. It was one of the scariest movies he had ever seen. At one point there was a scene that made him jump that he threw his popcorn over his head. Joey was so embarrassed, he scooted down in his chair. That did no good because his popcorn flew all over the couple two rolls behind him. The woman gave out a shriek and the guy yelled, \"hey man watch it\". Joey while scooting down, softly replied, \"sorry\".', 'fantasy', 1, 1, 0, '{}', '2022-06-19 14:08:21', 0, 0),

(18, 25, 'After the Rock', 'Humans can transform from solid to spirit in about half a second. I just found this out. Just a half-second ago. \r\n\r\nI might be shocked if I weren’t so dead.\r\n\r\n“Huh,” is all I have to say about it.\r\n\r\n“Yep,” my wife agrees, equally shockless.\r\n\r\nShe is standing beside me along the sun-baked shoulder of a two-lane country highway, and we are both staring down into the drainage ditch. At the bottom are scattered piles of junk — a nasty trail of breadcrumbs — all leading to a battered tomb. \r\n\r\nThe tomb used to be a car. For a while, it was our car. But that was before the rock.\r\n\r\n“How long have we been standing here?” I ask. \r\n\r\n“I think…” My wife’s hand becomes a vapor before reforming into fingers. She points at the junk in the ditch. A tire is still spinning. \r\n\r\n“…not long.”\r\n\r\nTime seems off. I count to five, but can’t tell if five seconds or five hours go by. We point out the broken pieces of what became our soul cocoon, transforming us from flesh into … whatever we are now. \r\n\r\n“See there? Mirror. Hubcap. Bumper…Shoe?”\r\n\r\n“My shoe,” she confirms, “Is there a foot inside?”\r\n\r\n“Looks empty,” I tell her. I notice my hands are balled into fists. I open them. “Do we just…stay here?”\r\n\r\nMy wife says, “I’m pretty sure that…” and another pause that’s either a second or a century “…we can do whatever we want.” \r\n\r\n“Well then.” I sound motivated, but I don’t move. “I’m gonna have a look at the wreck. Coming?”\r\n\r\n“No,” she tells me. “I don’t want to.”\r\n\r\nSomething like a laugh springs from my mouth. It sounds like a frother steaming mud. I feel funny and I laugh again because I’m so relieved to feel anything. It feels normal and good. Feeling feels good. \r\n\r\nI know it’s because of her.\r\n\r\nAnd for the first time since we found ourselves standing on the side of the road, I look her way. I can tell my eyebrow has lifted. “You don’t want to see your own corpse? Bullshit.” \r\n\r\nShe shrugs. At least I think she does. \r\n\r\n“It’s gruesome,” I tell her with the voice of a carnival barker. “It’s macabre! It’s the sum of a thousand nightmares. It’s…so you.” \r\n\r\n“I’m different.”\r\n\r\n“Nooo…Remember when you collected my blood from a nosebleed to make cake?”\r\n\r\n“I did not.”\r\n\r\n“You wanted to.”\r\n\r\n“True,” she says, “But I’m just not interested in empty shells.”\r\n\r\nAnd then she looks at me for the first time with the same eyebrow raised. “You want to see our dead bodies? Bullshit.”\r\n\r\nNow I’m shrugging. “I can take the gore.” \r\n\r\n“The sight of your own veins makes you queasy.”\r\n\r\n“I like scary movies.”\r\n\r\n“You like cartoon anatomy,” she clarifies. “But if it gets real...” \r\n\r\nShe squeezes her eyes shut, covers her ears, and goes “la-la-la” to make her point. It’s a good point. Clinical butchery makes me black out. But not anymore. Not after the rock. \r\n\r\nThe rock changed me in more ways than one.\r\n\r\n“I’m still me,” I say, smiling. “I think you’re still you.”\r\n\r\n“I guess we are. But who were we? What did we do?”\r\n\r\nI move. I think I’m walking. But there’s no tensing in my muscles, no popping in my knees. It’s weird and slow, but good. I’m still smiling. I say, “Baby, anything we forget is probably not worth remembering!” \r\n\r\nWhile I walk, she’s saying, “I remember what it feels like to hear a knock at the front door, knowing there’s a hot pizza waiting on the other side. I remember trees turning red and yellow and orange. Not like this.” She sounds disgusted. “All green…” \r\n\r\n“I remember that,” I say.\r\n\r\nShe goes on, “I remember the first sip of great wine out of the bottle and how it changes when it’s the last sip. I remember purring cats and photographs and staying home and seeing no one. I remember our wedding vows.”\r\n\r\n“Forever and then some,” I recite.\r\n\r\nThe mangled car-tomb is upside down and far too crumpled to look inside. I slip below the earth without digging, spying buried rocks and burrowed worms, all without dirtying my skin or clothes. \r\n\r\nWhat other tricks will I discover after the rock?\r\n\r\nMy head wafts up into what’s left of the front seat. \r\n\r\n“We’re not as gory as I thought!” I shout from the rubble.\r\n\r\n“Not so loud,” my wife tells me. “I can hear you just fine.”\r\n\r\n“Your eyes are open,” I say with a softer voice, just above a whisper. “You’re looking right at me.”\r\n\r\n“Am I looking at you or…you?”\r\n\r\n“Uh…dead me.”\r\n\r\n“Both of you are dead. Try again.”\r\n\r\n“Uh…the me that isn’t a ghost?” The G-word feels funny to say. I laugh a little. It sounds less frothy and more like it used to. “Your hair’s in your eyes.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not mine anymore.”\r\n\r\n“I just brushed it back. And touched your face. I think your skin is cold already, but I don’t know what cold feels like with these new fingers.”\r\n\r\n“I was always cold.” \r\n\r\n“And you were always beautiful. Even now. Hauntingly beautiful.”\r\n\r\nMy wife pretends to snore from the roadside. It’s what she does whenever I get cheesy.\r\n\r\n“I’m not kidding,” I say, louder again. “You wear death like it’s Chanel.”\r\n\r\nShe scoffs from the roadside. “Are you sure you’re not looking at someone else’s rotting wife?”\r\n\r\n“I’m serious. You barely look crushed. You could have an open coffin if you wanted.”\r\n\r\n“They wouldn’t dare.”\r\n\r\n“Not me, though. There’s a big hole in my head.”\r\n\r\n“Oh my love, that’s always been there.”\r\n\r\nWe both laugh at that, and I feel electricity. And also something that might be love. I remember love. I love that she called me my love. \r\n\r\nI stare at my dead body like I’m combing through a childhood photo album. Here’s me at 7 reading a book in a laundry basket. Here’s me at 10 dressed as Freddy Krueger for Halloween. Here’s me at 40-something, dead at the bottom of a ditch, in the middle of nowhere, with a hole in my head.\r\n\r\nPast blood and bone and gray matter, I can just make it out. “I see the rock.”\r\n\r\n“Where?” my wife asks. “In your brain?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. A bit gooey. I think I can grab it.”\r\n\r\n“Why would you?”\r\n\r\n“A keepsake? To show…I dunno…other ghosts?”\r\n\r\n“Do we have to? Other ghosts used to be people, you know.”\r\n\r\n“We don’t have to be their friends. I would just say, ‘Hey there, fellow spirit. Here’s the rock that struck me dead.’”\r\n\r\n“And they’ll say, ‘Booooo!’”\r\n\r\n“Because they’re ghosts?”\r\n\r\n“No, because they won’t find you as charming as you think.”\r\n\r\n“I’m taking the rock.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, but where will you keep it?” With patience, she explains: “You have no pockets. We have no house. Not anymore.”\r\n\r\n“Good point,” I say, finding nothing but mist where my pockets used to be. “I’d have to carry it in my hand. Forever.”\r\n\r\n“Uh-huh, uh-huh.” I can feel my wife nodding. She says, “And think of all the livvies. They’ll see nothing but a floating rock in the middle of the highway.”\r\n\r\n“Livvies?”\r\n\r\n“Living people,” she tells me. “I’m trying this new word out.”\r\n\r\n“Hey, I like that,” I say after frowning about it for a second. “Yeah. Probably scare the livvies to death.”\r\n\r\n“Then they’d never leave us alone.”\r\n\r\n“How terrifying.” And I’m standing beside her again — out of the car, up from the ditch, and now on the side of the road. She’s looking up at the sky and whistling the first 8 notes of “If I Only had a Brain” from The Wizard of Oz, which she often did when she was alive. It passed the time. \r\n\r\nShe might be doing it now because of the rock in my brain.\r\n\r\nI look where she’s looking, see what she’s seeing. It’s daytime, but the skies show us everything, all the stars and all the worlds. Thousands of satellites race by in streaks alongside a billion shooting stars. And all the clouds are funny shapes. I see a cumulus egg hatching a skeleton hand.\r\n\r\n“That’s nice,” I say, then look back at the soul cocoon. \r\n\r\nI try and fail to recall the crash. “It must have been a swift death. I only remember driving past that big tractor mower. The one over there in the farmland.” \r\n\r\nI point, but the tractor mower is gone. I listen and hear the faint growl of a monstrous engine coming from somewhere in the tall grass.\r\n\r\n“Anyway,” I continue, “I was driving when I heard a crack. Then … we were standing here. All like that.” I snap my fingers, but I don’t hear them clap or feel the vibration in my hand. I try again and again without success. It looks like I’m playing the world’s smallest violin for our interred bodies.\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t that quick,” my wife tells me.\r\n\r\n“No?”\r\n\r\n“Your window shattered. Your body crashed into mine. We veered towards the ditch. We flew here and twisted. We tumbled there and crunched. We rolled and I stopped breathing. We landed upside down and it got very quiet. I tried to scream, but I choked. Then I was standing here with you.”\r\n\r\nShe says all this matter-of-factly, like she’s reciting the steps of a cookie recipe.\r\n\r\n“That must have been scary.”\r\n\r\n“Eh.” She shrugs again. “Maybe then.” \r\n\r\nShe whistles some more, always the same 8 notes. I watch her watch the corn and soybeans, taking stock of her familiar spirit. Hazel eyes, shiny teeth, and the frail trace of a scar where a dog once bit her cheek as a child. Amazing that it’s all still there. Her skin is smooth and pale, the way corpses appear in Gothic horror. She looks the part. I imagine we both do. Even before the crash, we rejected suntans and freckles. We were born to be dead.\r\n\r\nMy wife sees me watching her. “What?” she asks. “I got something on me? Is it a bug?”\r\n\r\nI tell her, “There’s no such thing as ghost…bugs.” But I check her scalp anyway just to be sure.\r\n\r\nShe asks me, “What do you want to do now?”\r\n\r\nI would sigh in thought if I still had lungs. I pretend to inhale, exhale. I drum my fingers against the wind the way I’m sure all ghosts fidget when they consider options. I say, “Let’s go find that tractor mower.”\r\n\r\n“What for?” my wife asks.\r\n\r\n“I think we should haunt it.”\r\n\r\n“A tractor?”\r\n\r\n“Or at least bum a ride into town.”\r\n\r\nShe repeats herself, but slowly. “A track-ah-tor?”\r\n\r\n“Why not? It did this to us, after all.” \r\n\r\nWhen we passed the tractor mower, alive, it was cutting the tall grass maybe twenty feet away, scattering green blades over the highway. No mere riding mower, but a hulk with a sealed cab. Nothing else could have launched the rock with such force. All the rest is nature — cruel and vicious, but never armed with missiles. \r\n\r\nI see no cornstalk catapults. No soybean sharp-shooters.\r\n\r\nIt was the hulk. It mowed up the rock in the tall grass and threw a perfect strike into my skull. \r\n\r\nThe driver didn’t stop when we crashed. He either didn’t see what happened, or he panicked and tractored himself behind green cover, or he didn’t care that we tumbled and rolled and died. How can anyone end a life and not feel a rot in their core?\r\n\r\nI look and spot glints of sunlight flashing behind farmland camouflage. I see the glass of the tractor’s cab. It is still mowing somewhere in the thick of the grass. Or maybe hiding.\r\n\r\nMy wife considers for another century-second. “Okay, sure.”\r\n\r\nWe take our first steps across the highway and, suddenly, we are standing in the path of the giant tractor, surrounded by tall grass. Two hundred feet traveled in a blink. My wife smiles and asks if we just did magic.\r\n\r\n“It’s all magic,” I say — even though, before the rock, I didn’t believe in anything I couldn’t prove with each of my senses.\r\n\r\nWe stand still and lock eyes with the driver, expecting him to double-take and squint and gawk and scream and clutch his chest in utter horror. He doesn’t. He can’t see us. The tractor mower rolls over my wife and me, and, in another sudden blink, we are in the cab with the driver. He’s not a he, but a she in flannel with a trucker hat pulled low. A girl of twenty, perhaps. She is looking down at her phone, thumbing a text message, waiting for reply.\r\n\r\nI imagine a series of public service posters designed for farm equipment. \r\n\r\nDistracted Tractor in bold print above a cartoon combine that gleefully swallows children while its driver is glued to a phone. \r\n\r\nDon’t text and mow. \r\n\r\nI wonder if there are ad agencies in Heaven. I wonder if there’s a Heaven. I wonder why nothing has come to collect us. I’m not worried. Haunting farmers with my wife ain’t a bad way to spend Eternity.\r\n\r\nMy wife jabs the driver in the back where a wing would be if the girl was an angel instead of a murderer.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I shout in her ear: “Get out!” because it seemed the ghostly thing to say.\r\n\r\nThe driver obeys in electro-shock spasms. She jumps from the tractor, howling various vowels. She stumbles and limps and flees the farmland. Her fright is everything I hoped it would be. \r\n\r\nUnmanned, the farm hulk keeps rolling, and I wonder whether it will die in a ditch or topple a barn.\r\n\r\n“That was fun,” I say.\r\n\r\n“But you’re frowning,” my wife tells me.\r\n\r\n“Am I?” \r\n\r\nShe paints an ectoplasm smile over my murky face.\r\n\r\nI say, “I guess it all felt kinda pointless.”\r\n\r\n“What did? Scaring her?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, god no. Revenge for the rock. I thought it would taste sweet. But it just tastes like celery.”\r\n\r\n“Who cares? So what? Do it for fun next time.”\r\n\r\nMy wife has always been the wisest of them all. \r\n\r\nWe push every button and pull every lever until the tractor mower comes to a stop.\r\n\r\nI say, “Well, anyway, I’m sure she didn’t mean to.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure,” my wife agrees.\r\n\r\nAnother blink takes us three hundred feet away from the lulled behemoth. We are back at the roadside crash. We are together. I reach for her hand as she reaches for mine, and a spark of light ignites between us for an instant as we touch and clasp.\r\n\r\nA cobalt Camaro drives by, flashing high beam headlights, and I realize the world is suddenly shaded in moonlight blue. The Camaro has somehow brought the night. It is backlit by stars and galaxies and the blinking red beacons of distant TV towers. \r\n\r\nTime. Acting weird again.\r\n\r\nThe Camaro slows down as it passes the edge of the ditch where we died. The livvies inside are all aglow in their dashboard lights. We are separated by life and death, but they can see us … and we them. \r\n\r\nOur eyes meet. Theirs are the size of bocce balls, bulging from their skulls, on the brink of escape. Both livvy jaws hinge to the breaking point. They look like a pair of airhead babies, opening wide for a spoonful of horror. \r\n\r\nWe feed them.\r\n\r\nThe Camaro nearly spills into the ditch graveyard. I reach out my hand and shout, “Be careful, you idiots!”\r\n\r\nThis makes them shriek and snap and jerk the wheel back along the center line. Their heads swivel back and forth, rubbernecking for one more look.\r\n\r\nOr maybe their heads are just shaking a violent protest. NO, I won’t believe my eyes. NO, they weren’t real. \r\n\r\nI think I saved their lives. What a relief. Company is my nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe car vanishes with a punch of acceleration, taking the night with it. Daylight returns just as it was a few seconds ago. The livvies are gone, but I can see their future. I listen as they tell a thousand stories about us over the next thirty years: \r\n\r\nThat’s where we saw them! The dead lovers! They’re trapped in limbo, forever searching for their wrecked car. One of them screeched at me, trying to crash us into the ditch where they died.\r\n\r\nWhat a crock. I know where my car is. I just don’t care anymore.\r\n\r\nMy wife touches my cheek and asks, “Better?”\r\n\r\n“Much,” I reply. \r\n\r\n“They’ll call us the Demon Sweethearts of Route 24!” \r\n\r\nOur future legacy makes her giddy. Me, too.\r\n\r\n“We’re a ghost story now,” I say. “We’ve gone legend.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s do it again. Somewhere else. There’s a million places to make better stories. Think of all the fun we’ll have.”\r\n\r\n“Forever and then some.” I look deep into her soul. I squeeze her hand and feel warmth even though we’re just bloodless, fleshless thoughts and memories. I tell her, “I’m so happy you didn’t survive.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the sweetest thing you could have said.” Her tears float up and away like defiant rain. She says, “If you were still alive, I’d strangle you.”\r\n\r\n“I’m the luckiest dead man in the whole wide world.”\r\n\r\nShe pulls me to the middle of the road where a minivan is fast approaching. Unlike the Camaro, it doesn’t carry the night, nor do its livvy riders see us standing here. \r\n\r\n“We’re going to leave this tomb behind,” my wife declares.\r\n\r\nThe minivan runs us over. We get scooped up, becoming invisible passengers. The livvies are singing along to some terrible song. \r\n\r\nI break the radio.\r\n\r\n“This is nice,” my wife says. And it is.\r\n\r\nWe’ll ride quietly till we stop in the first town or city or lakeside cabin surrounded by deep dark woods. My wife’s hand passes through the sliding door to fly on the wind. Her head is on my shoulder.\r\n\r\nShe says, “What a day.”', 'Humans can transform from solid to spirit in about half a second. I just found this out.

(19, 26, 'The Untold Story', 'Once there were lovers who always fought with each other. Their relationship falls on on and off basis. One day the girl decided to left him for good. \"This is the first and last time we\'ll ever see each other again,\" the woman said angrily and stalk angrily out the house for the man did not even try to stop her. \r\n\r\nHe just stood at the door with the thoughtful exression on his face. Then he went inside and lock the dor. The next day the woman came back realizing that she really don\'t want to leave him. She \'s just furious that he had been ignoring her lately and kept locking himself up in his studio. Only to be rebuff by the man. \"Go away Selena...I don\'t want you anymore,\" the man said and turn to get inside and lock the door to her utter disbelief. \r\n\r\nFor he never lock the door no matter how much they quarreled. The woman cried and cried til night comes. The door never opened and realizing that he really don\'t want to see her anymore, she turn and leave the place with broken heart and a promise she will never come back. Weeks passed. Months that turn into a year. The woman never did return anymore. The man seldom left his loft. He kept himself locked in his solitary apartment. \r\n\r\nThen one faithful night, he passed away. Did he commit suicide? It\'s not for us to conclude...but here\'s how it goes... It was almost 2 months now since the doctor told him of his illness. Brain tumor... The words haunted him like a ghosts. Death seems to hunt him too for now and then he feel his head searing with extreme pain. He look at Selena and could\'nt bear to hurt her with the truth for she had nobody but him alone. So he lock himself up in his studio where he paint everytime the agony of pain hit him. And while his head ache he paint and paint...in bold strokes portraying the agony he feel upon his illness and the misery of leaving her alone in this world. \r\n\r\nThen one day she left him thinking he is taking her for granted and he did not try to correct her belief. He was thankful to see her go praying that someday she will find someone to look after her since he could not anymore. But then she came back and he was torn in two. He wanted to kiss and hug her...tell her how much he love her but the pain strikes again...this time it was so intense he was near to crying out. So he lock the door and never open it fearing she will see him that way. \r\n\r\nSo he painted and painted and sent a letter to a co-painter. Then one faithful night...it was over and death took away all the misery and pain he is suffering. News reached the distant lands so fast and Selena rush immediately to their old appartment. The run down loft where they once happily live but not anymore. \r\n\r\nWhen she arrive there, the neighbors already buried him for he had no relatives and friend to mourn for him. He was a solitary man. Then his co-painter arrive with a box and a letter. \"Ray ask me to give this to you upon his death. And also here is the money his paintings earned during our exhibit.\" \"Exhibit?\" \"Yeah...he did\'nt told you about the works of art he painted? All were masterpiece...all portraying the feeling of pain..Luckily it was all sold out.\" She felt numb and dazed upon hearing this. After the painter left she immediately read the letter. \r\n\r\nMy beloved Selena You don\'t know how much I ache everytime I ignored you. Please believe me. I do not want to do this. You are the only one I ever cared and love about. But I cannot look after you anymore. I was diagnosed of brain tumor and it\'s fatal with no chance of recovery. \r\n\r\nEveryday I\'m dying and the pain is intensifying. But what hurts even more is letting you see me suffer. It would break your heart I know. You always draw strength from me and I don\'t know if you could take this. So I try to hide my pains from you everytime I lock the door. Please do not think that I neglect you. You are always my top priority. When you read this letter please forget me. Move on and go on with your life.. I cannot rest my soul knowing I left you in misery. \r\n\r\nFind someone who can love you more than I love you. And take care of you for eternity for I did not have the chance to do that anymore. I also ask Sam to give the profits of all the paintings he sold on the exhibit. Anyway, I could not come to the exhibit myself coz I\'m already feeling weak.\r\n\r\n And by the way I left a painting for you one that I did not intend to sell. For it is my only gift for you. Hope you will keep it for me.\" Love, Ray She opened the box and cried so hard upon seeing what\'s inside. It was a portrait of her in her blue dress in one summer day. \r\n\r\nThe day when she first saw him and the day when they first met and fall inlove witch other. She remembered that day she ask him what he was painting. And he smiled and reply \"I\'m painting one of my masterpiece...one of the very beautiful image I\'ve ever seen. and one that I will keep forever in my heart and cherish forever.\" So now she\'s looking at that great masterpiece. The image of herself in her old blue dress one distant summer day.\r\n', 'Once there were lovers who always fought with each other.

(20, 27, 'Broken Head', 'One Sunday afternoon. I decided to take Toke out for a romantic lunch. I returned home from the regular Sunday service and drove out my Toyota Camry 2005 model. I drove down to her house and only one song kept playing in my mind and that was TuFace\'s African Queen which I played on my car mp3 and kept it on repeat. \r\n\r\nThe song reminds me of only one person and that was Toke. The drive from my house to her apartment was less than 10 minutes because we lived in the same neighborhood. She was already waiting and as soon as I stopped in front of her gate, she entered and I drove off. We chatted romantically as we travelled.\r\n\r\n We were almost at the cinema when all of a sudden. My car, or should I say that another car ran into mine but the summary of the whole event then was that we both ran into each other. I was flabbergasted and quickly stepped out of my vehicle to check the amount of damaged done to my favorite vehicle. \"My God!\" I screamed simultaneously placing my hands on my head in the Moku, Mogbe, Modaran mode. By the time I turned around, I saw the owner of the vehicle. \r\n\r\nHe was a young fresh looking man, around my age or a little lesser cause I definitely looked older than him but he looked more expensive than and was clearly visible from his dressing as he was flamboyantly with gold chains around his neck, gold rings in all his fingers and tattoos on both arms. He could easily pass for a yahoo boy with this mode of dressing. Well, I didn\'t care about that, I was more concerned with my car. \"Sorry\" was the first word he said and the thought of what sorry would solve roughly sipped into my head. \"Sorry!?\" I lashed \"Young man are you telling me sorry? Where you blind?\" I could read the shock on his face as I must have flummoxed his mind.\r\n\r\n He took about two steps back staring at me with a look that read “Sho, what\'s wrong with this one o\" but I over looked it. While we were still staring at each other, I in rage and he with his I don\'t care. Toke stepped out and spoke. \"Ewo! Baby, can you imagine this, that\'s how all this young boys (pointing at the man) who think they are rich use to behave, look now, he has destroyed your car headlight, and his car only suffered a light scratch, I suggest you better break his own.\" She and without twice about her suggestion I scanned the area found a club which is utilized in the process of carrying out the act of breaking the two headlights of his car which was a range rover sport 2013 model. \"Jeez man! What did you that for\" the guy said with what I believe is a made up American accent. \r\n\r\n\"Weytin be jeez, my friend you better leave English and fix my car sharp sharp” I blotted. That same instant, he retrieved his iPhone from his pocket and made a call and before long a man suited up as a mechanic arrived the scene on a motorbike carrying two headlights. He greeted me casually and headed to hail the other man and right there in my presence he replaced the broken headlights with the ones he brought along with him while I stood at the same spot flabbergasted with such a sudden act of flamboyance. \r\n\r\n\"Hey bro!!\" I heard the man echo for the second time which brought me back to reality. “I just fixed your headlights I think the proper thing you need to is to also reciprocate man\" he requested. His words felt like The Big Show\'s famous knockout punch landing heavily on me and sending me into a flashback trying to pick out where I took the wrong decision by smashing his headlights all because I lost my cool at the first instant, now I know the wisdom in the phrase \"Never take permanent decisions on temporary feelings\". \r\n\r\nI just stared at him with a pitiful face and looked around for Toke, hopefully she could also feel my pain and assist in the pleading am about to embark on because I don\'t need a pastor or prophet that I can\'t afford to buy the two headlights only to find her chewing gum loudly in the car and taking irritating selfies in the car.\r\n\r\n I wish I could write further but as the memories comes back my injuries refreshes and the tears of defeat rolls back.', 'One Sunday afternoon.

(23, 30, 'Towards His Summer', 'Summer. Ah, I love summer. Summers have always been the best part of the year for me. I would visit Pops every summer without fail. Pops is my father\'s adoptive father. Dad says he likes having company and I was always the best candidate considering we had the same idea of what\'s fun and what\'s not. 10 years of visiting Pops without fail. Travelling was never a problem for me even if it took us at least 6 hours by car or bus. \r\n\r\nThis little bubble of excitement inside me wells up as I see the view from my window change from a bustling metropolis to a sleepy backwater town where everybody knew everybody. When I was little, Dad always had to drive me to Pops but as soon as I became 12, I just rode the bus while Pops waited at the only bus stop in town waiting for me. I\'ve spent 10 summers with Pops but I never really knew him. \r\n\r\nDad said he was once a doctor of sorts who quit his practice after his wife died. Other townspeople say that Pops was a real somebody back in the day. They say that he was a big shot journalist who had to hide from a couple of bad people from the city and that is why he retreated to the boondocks. Personally, I never knew much about Pops. All I knew is that he likes milk in the morning and a swig of whiskey in the evening. He likes striped bass more than rainbow trout and he never really liked Babe Ruth as a person. \r\n\r\nHe is indifferent with political issues but believes somebody better should lead the country. He also likes sitting by the porch every afternoon watching the plains roll at the distance. He had little to no problems with life and everybody in town loved him. He never gave to charity but always had a job for somebody who needed bread. He also said he stared into the jaws of a bear once and lived. He also likes talking about how Elvis Presley was the next messiah but the world wasn\'t really ready for him. \r\n\r\nHe never used salt in his food but was always craving beef jerky. It was always fun spending summer with Pops. As soon as school closed, I was already preparing my stuff when Dad entered my room and said that he will be driving me to Pops. I said it was OK and that I can just take the bus as usual but he insisted that he does\r\n\r\n. We went our way the morning after and we arrived at Pop\'s place right around noon. The place looked empty. It was a 4-room bungalow and there were two rooms that I was not allowed to enter. One was his study and the other was his room. Dad emptied the car and went inside. There was a lovely lady inside the house who greeted us. I have never seen her my entire life but it seemed like she knew my father. The house looked the same way I remembered it a year ago. \r\n\r\nThe creaky door, the mismatched drapes, the musty smell of mold in the ceiling it was how I remembered it. I asked Dad if he knew where Pops was and he said he\'s in his room. The lady motions dad towards the room and said I could wait in his study. It was the first time for me to enter that room. \r\n\r\nThe room was empty aside from a couple of tables and some books on the shelves. In the center of the room was an old chair that looked like one the dentist uses, but it looked much older than the ones with levers and lights. On the table was an old typewriter with some pieces of paper on the side. On them were stories. I sat down on the old dentist\'s chair and picked up the papers by the side of the typewriter. Tears ran down my cheeks when I read the first line on what seemed to be a recollection of memories. \"In a month, his summer is about to start while it seems like the summer of my life is coming to an end\"', 'Summer.

His room became a room full of futuristic toys. A hoverboard, A yo-yo that can float and a speaking robotic dog! The boy exclaimed, \"Is this my future, Grandpa?\" \"You can say that. This is the room of your son.\" He kneeled down on one knee and smiled. \"My son?\" the boy asked while scratching his head. Grandfather Time nodded in reply and said, \"Come and follow me, I have something to show you.\" They opened the room\'s door and walked towards the hallway until he suddenly stopped. \"What\'s the problem, little one?\" \"That\'s a photograph of me and my family.\" He said while pointing it out. \"Of course it will be there. This is your future home after all.\" He sighed. \"But where am I now?\" Grandfather Time fell silent. The boy saw his face, gloomy and sad, and asked worryingly, \"Why is your face like that?\".\r\n\r\n\"Time is absolute and never wavers. It is cruel.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Grandpa?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the time your son was born, you passed away.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was shocked.

(26, 16, 'On the Run', 'I\'ve learned several things over the past few hours. One of those things was this: I didn’t know much of anything. Lots of questions have come to mind during my time away from home. How was I supposed to survive without money? Why did everyone treat me like I was meaningless? And why were boys so annoying? None of these have been answered.\r\n\r\nThe boy brushing past my shoulder as he ran from the overweight baker was the very same boy who had gotten me into this mess. He was always running from someone, and that should have been the first sign that something was wrong. This time though, he wasn\'t the only one running.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” he yells in my ear, grabbing my hand and pulling me away from the large man. His face was bright red and smoke puffed out of his ears as his short legs carried him toward us at a speed that should have been impossible for him.\r\n\r\nTurning from the cherry tomato, I follow the boy as he drags me along. We squeeze between clumps of people, causing angry muttering to follow in our wake. Then we come across a dark skinned woman in a large skirt. She was stooped over, looking at a fruit stand covered in bright colors of all kinds, her skirt blocking our path in the crowded street. Pulling up short, I glance around, hoping for some other escape route. Finding none, I huff and turn to the boy.\r\n\r\n“What is wrong with you?” I hiss at him angrily, not wanting to draw attention to ourselves. I jerk my hand out of his grasp and he turns to look at me.\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong with you?” he returns, grabbing my arm again. Then he spins toward the woman and pulls me into her skirt behind him. I scream and cover my eyes with my free hand, but the woman’s scream drowns me out. We plow through the fabrics and come out the other side, wails of horror left behind us. Opening my eyes and looking back at the scene we had created, I see the large baker trying to squeeze past the frazzled woman. I watch as she smacks him with her bag. His face grows redder and he rubs his face, tears glistening in his eyes.\r\n\r\nI hear the boy laugh in front of me and I turn back to face him. “That guy’s just a big baby,” he tells me. “We’ve got nothing to worry about.”\r\n\r\nI glare at him and speed up, dragging him behind me now. Turning sharply into a dark alley, I skid to a halt and let go, sending him sprawling onto the dirt floor. He looks up and asks, “What was that for?”\r\n\r\nI bend down and pick up the loaf of bread that had fallen out of his grasp. “No. What was this for?”\r\n\r\n“Food.” He stands up, grinning widely as he dusts off his trousers.\r\n\r\nI roll my eyes. What a stupid boy. “I know that,” I inform him. “Why did you steal it?”\r\n\r\n“Why are you asking such dumb questions? I wanted to eat it, so I took it.” His face was no longer smiling. Instead, he looked confused and annoyed.\r\n\r\nI was more annoyed. “That man was trying to kill us!”\r\n\r\n“No he wasn’t.” He grabs the loaf out of my hand and takes a large bite. His mouth full he says, “He was only going to throw us behind bars.”\r\n\r\n“And that’s somehow better?”\r\n\r\n“Uh, yeah.” He holds his snack out to me. “Want some? It’s not the best one in town, but it’s still good.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not hungry,” I tell him. No way was I going to eat stolen bread that had fallen on the ground. Mother and Father had taught me better than that.\r\n\r\nMy stomach growled loudly, echoing in the dark space. The boy smirked at me and waved the bread in the air, the scent making my mouth water.\r\n\r\n“Fine.” I snatched the bread out of his hands and bit into the crunchy loaf. The inside was warm and soft, completely contrasting with the outer shell. Its flavor fills my mouth and the warmth lines my stomach.\r\n\r\n“It’s not that good.” I look up and see the boy grinning his stupid grin at me again. When I glare at him, he merely asks, “What did you say your name was?”\r\n\r\n“Ida.” I hand him his bread and wipe my mouth on my sleeve before I realize what I’m doing. I look down at the now greasy sleeve and frown. This dress was made for that kind of thing anyway.\r\n\r\n“Cool,” I hear the boy say. Looking up at him, I can’t help but give a small smile. He grins again and tells me, “My name’s Ernest.”\r\n\r\n“There you are!”\r\n\r\nWe both turn towards the voice and find the large baker standing over us, his face redder than before.\r\n\r\n“Still think there’s nothing to worry about?” I ask, inwardly cursing the deranged boy and his antics. Taking a cautious step, I slowly back away from the panting man who was now the color of a beat.\r\n\r\n“I may have underestimated him,” Ernest responds, following my lead and slowly backing away too. I look over and almost scoff at him.\r\n\r\nBut the apron-wearing beat demands my full attention. He draws closer steadily, arms outstretched, smiling wickedly. “You won’t be bothering me any more,” he says, more to himself than to us.

(27, 31, 'These Walls Can Talk', 'I suppose I should have seen it coming. My occupants steadily left their spaces one by one a while ago now, leaving me empty and very alone. My hollow insides long for something to fill the void, something to breathe life into these old lungs.\r\n\r\nI am one of the last buildings left standing. I have watched several others in the area disappear over the last year or so. I didn’t understand why I felt increasingly anxious with every explosion and subsequent cloud of dust, smoke, and debris. But as each building succumbed to the blasts, my anxiety turned into a sense of abandonment and further into despair. I realized the likelihood of my own demise was sure to come, that eventually, I would be left behind as a solitary pillar on the horizon. Here one day, gone the next. A pile of rubble merely to be discarded and swiftly forgotten.\r\n\r\nI was proud to be the first apartment building erected in this corner of the city. Originally built in 1875 to house working-class families, I stood nearly alone for a short while as the construction of a large bridge was started nearby. Soon the city around me began to buzz with new inhabitants and new construction. The view on every side of me morphed quickly as building after building popped up, each one like a Jack in the Box. Before I knew it, the city was full of life, structures set tightly together, and people moving in droves, brushing shoulders in the street, or riding the elevated trains to get from Point A to Point B. \r\n\r\nIt was fascinating to see how the city changed and grew over the years. Immigrants from foreign lands began to crowd the city. Each group seemed to prefer living amongst those of their same heritage. I quickly understood why when I listened to them speak in unfamiliar languages, it certainly made it easier for communication purposes, among other things.\r\n\r\nOver time the neighborhood I stood in became known as Little Italy. The Italians were a charismatic bunch, noisy and full of life. They made every day seem like a party. And, oh my, did they have a way with food! Each meal was an aromatic delight, filling me not only with robust scents but a warm, tingling feeling of love, which I assumed was what it felt like to be part of a family. So many wonderful memories of those that called me home linger.\r\n\r\nMy heart swells as I think of all the momentous occasions that took place in these homes. Celebrations, mourning, births, deaths, anniversaries, divorce, lost teeth, Christmas miracles, and every other ordinary day in between. The children who played in the halls. The women who tidied their homes and tended to their children, who made dinners for their working husbands each evening. The fathers who returned after a long day, eager to get home to the families waiting for them.\r\n', 'I suppose I should have seen it coming.

She drove around looking for a nearby branch and finally found one a few blocks away from her new office. After all those years, she unexpectedly met him there. As she first set foot inside the bank, she recognized him from behind. She stood in front of the machine near the entrance and extracted a ticket to meet with a customer service representative.

He was simultaneously serious, funny, and down to earth. He saw her from afar and smiled at her. She looked away timidly, hoping that he didn\'t notice she was staring at him. When it was her turn, she sat in front of him with a beet-red face. The palms of her hands began to sweat, which happened every time she got nervous. His eyes lit up, and he smiled at her.

Then he looked at her, \"So, did you need any help?\"\r\n\r\nShe began fiddling with her hands, \"Maybe another day. I just need to take some money out. I will go to the machine outside.

He slammed the pillow over his head and smothered the ill sense it was in his living room. After a late night at the law office, he’d downed a glass of a Scotch whiskey, while mind numbing on Netflix. His mouth was dry and his head was pounding. A gluey residue clamped his dry lips together.\r\n\r\nHe heard loud knocking at his door, and flinched, when he heard Molly his neighbour shouting his name, in her ex-smoker’s ratchety voice.  He kept his head under the pillow and tried to decide between remaining quiet or getting up and dealing with that interfering busybody.  \r\n\r\nThe knocking continued. Didn’t she have a life, a schedule to command her attention. No, she was a ‘writer’ and stayed home all day long and did nothing, but poke her nose into everyone else’s business.

(36, 34, 'Birth Mother', 'I stand in a perfectly pristine kitchen. The counter tops are covered in flour. She stands at them, waiting for me. She’s rolling out the cookie dough in deep, even strokes, like the ocean kissing the beach. Her soft humming fills the kitchen with love. Her hands lift me up; I\'m in a navy blue sundress with little yellow sunflowers on it. “Here, sweetie,” she hands me an apron and I lift my little arms obediently to her. She ties it around my waist. A little teddy bear clutching a rolling pin in one soft, brown paw is splashed across my tummy. And beside me, she rolls. I watch the muscles in his taunt arms ripple with the pressure. The sunlight makes the sugar glisten and sparkle like glitter. The room smells sweetly of the confections we are working so diligently to create. She smiles at me and gestures at the cookie cutters. \r\n\r\nThere’s some part of me that knows that these cookie cutters are Mama’s. Why does she have Mama’s special cookie cutters I wonder. They are a deep copper color and Mama got them from her mama who got them from her mama. For 11 and a half months out of the year, they’re stored in worn gallon sized baggies with zipper seals. The bags feel rough on my little fingers, but Mama says they don’t need to be replaced yet. When they cascade out of the bags, they play a chorus of music that sounds like their own Christmas carol as they crash onto the wooden table. Maggie’s fingers and mine grasp and reach for our favorite shapes. Mama tells us that we need to cut out the big shapes on the gingerbread dough first, as she nibbles a morsel. So Maggie and I press the big giant angel; her wings are the span of my palm. “Press down firmly,” she instructs, placing her soft palm onto ours. It hurts for a moment, but when we release we can see the shape of the angel. Delicately, Mama scoops the angel onto the cookie pan. Maggie is in her corner, pressing the cut out of holiday bells into one corner. When we’ve done all our little hearts can, Mama balls up the dough and rolls it out again. Maggie and I nibble on the cookie dough giggling while singing, “Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!” So why does the woman have Mama’s cutters?\r\n\r\nWhen she looks at me, I notice she’s Asian. Like me. I trace my almond shaped eyes and examine hers. I trace the slope of my button nose while memorizing the slope of hers. She smiles and her eyes crinkle just like mine. “How can you possibly see when you smile like that,” the white school photographer asked me so I stopped smiling in the photos. But she doesn’t ask me. She knows. Her long fingers indicate Mama’s cookie cutters, but I don’t feel right using them without her. I shake my head, so the woman grabs a cutter. She cuts out the shape of the bells. “Mama says you need to cut the big shapes first,” I protest and reach for the big angel. But she disappears. I search the counters wildly. Then, I reach for the biggest gingerbread man instead, who is as tall as the angel. I grasp him tightly and press him into the dough.\r\n\r\nThe woman nods encouragingly. She presses her hand into mine and since she is standing so close I can smell her perfume. The scent of almonds fills my nose. It\'s sweet and light. And I want more of it. Her hand is cold against mine. Mama’s is never cold. “Where’s Maggie,” I ask. Mama says we can’t make cookies without my little sister by my side. It’s the rules. The woman doesn’t answer, just shakes her head. Her long, black hair cascades around her shoulders. The woman reaches up and ties it with a long, single, thick, red ribbon. I notice she’s wearing earrings. Little pearls. Like the kind I asked for when Mama let me pierce my ears. \r\n\r\nI hear the sound of a timer going off. The woman begins pressing shapes into the dough with expert speed. She chooses the bells, a small angel, two little men, and one snowman. I just stand back and watch. The dough dries on my palms and I dust them off. She has filled a tray. The woman grips the silver nonstick sheet tightly and opens the oven. When she turns I see she’s in a cashmere, cream colored sweater. The kind I have only ever seen Granny wear, not one Mama would wear. Mama wears bright red sweatshirts with Snoopy from Peanuts decorating his little red house for Christmas on them. I also notice the tan pants and little ballet flats on the woman’s feet. They have a big gold belt buckle. Those aren’t Mama’s shoes, either. She wears bright red Converse All Stars with her bright red sweaters. When the woman opens the oven door, the heat engulfs me.\r\n\r\nI’m a little uncomfortable and I fumble with the straps of my little dress. The woman returns to the counter and scoops up the dough. She balls it tightly and flours the counter. I watch her roll out the dough and begin the process again. \r\n\r\nThe timer sings loudly. The woman has filled the next cookie sheet. She walks to the oven, releases the cookies, and sets them on top of the stove. With expert precision she spins on her heel and pops the tray of dough in. I want to ask her why she left me, why she let me be adopted. But the words don’t come. Instead, she begins arranging the cookies on a silver cooling rack on the counter by the tan stove. Mama never uses cooling racks. She just lets the cookies cool on the trays. Once the cookies are arranged the woman returns to me. The once monstrous ball of dough is now very small. She tears a chunk of it off and drops it in the palm of my hand. She smiles and tears some for herself. I notice her impeccable white teeth. The way her eyes crinkle makes mine crinkle. The dough is sweet and just a little bit spicy. It melts in my mouth.\r\n\r\nThe woman places the first cookie sheet in the perfectly white sink. It has no other dishes. Mama’s sink always has other dishes. Maggie’s colorful sippy cups and plastic plates that are all sectioned off so her broccoli doesn’t touch her Mac and Cheese which doesn’t touch her fish sticks. The woman places the second tray of cookies on the stove as she did with the first and begins arranging the cookies onto another cooling rack. I stand on my little step stool and reach for the dessert plates. They’re decorated with llamas wearing holiday lights and Santa hats. There are little leaves of holly along the edges. The woman takes the plates from my hands and loads them with some of the cookies from the first batch, all cooled and ready to be devoured. She also pours a couple glasses of milk. That’s just like Mama. “A little protein with your treat, my loves,” she’d say to Maggie and me. The woman and I sit at Mama’s kitchen table. The cookies are crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. I bite the head off the big angel which makes the woman laugh. I want to hear more so I tear into her left wing, then her right. The woman is laughing loudly. I wonder if Mama can hear and I wonder where Mama is. I feel tears pricking the back of my little black eyes. My eyes look just like that woman’s. She offers me a hug. But I don’t want her. I want Mama. \r\n\r\nI awake to the sound of eggs being fried. The morning sun cuts through a thin pink curtain. Maggie can sleep through it, though. “She’s always been a heavy sleeper,” says Mama when I tell her she doesn’t want breakfast. Mama marches up to me. She lifts my chin so I can gaze into her soft blue eyes. Eyes, not like mine. “Are you ok, sweetheart, you look like you’ve had a rough night,” she says. Her voice is soft. It sounds like home. My eyes nervously dart to the tallest cabinet in the kitchen. To the home of the cookie cutters. I don’t have to answer as Maggie stumbles in. My sister devours her eggs and pancakes that Mama has cut into achievable bites for her. “Now remember, today we’re going to the eye doctor after school,” Mama says. She always reminds us of our schedule during breakfast. Mama glances at the kitchen clock; the one with the big cat eyes that dart back and forth as time passes. She claps her hands and begins clearing the table. I gulp down my glass of milk and race Maggie to our shared bathroom to brush our teeth. My mind is drifting to the woman. \r\n\r\nMama is waiting by the door, clutching our backpacks. Maggie’s is blue. Mine is pink. We rush into the car. I am still haunted by the woman in the dream. By her smile most especially. Mama picks Maggie and me up in the pickup lane at school. We pile into her white civic and she asks us the best part of our day. Maggie says the cafeteria served Mac and Cheese. I say I am sick of Mac and Cheese. We drive to a big, red brick building with lots of windows. Mama drives up and down the lanes of cars for a while. Maggie is singing some song she learned about the four seasons and swinging her feet. Mama tells her to stop kicking the seat. Maggie doesn’t stop. We finally park and Mama takes our hands. My left hand slips into her right. Mama’s hands are warm and soft. I like them more than the woman from my dream’s hands. We walk into the air conditioned building. Our feet sound loud and squeaky on the tile floor. There is a large water fountain which Maggie rushes up to. Her little fingers reach for the water. “We’ll come back when we’re done,” Mama promises. She ushers us into the office with the blue eye on the glass door. I take in the large room full of glasses. Mama marches up to the counter and brushes her gray hair from her face. She talks with the lady with the red lipstick and redder hair who tells us to stand against the white wall for a picture. I don’t smile. \r\n\r\nMama sits in the middle of Maggie and me. I can feel my palms getting sweaty and reach for Mama’s hand. She strokes mine gently so I open up my palm. I press my fingers into hers and giggle because the top of my nails only reach ⅔ up her finger. “You’re growing so big,” she whispers. A woman in blue scrubs calls out Maggie and my names. We jump up and follow her into another big white room. “I’m going first because I am the oldest,” I proclaim. Maggie does not protest. She has us sit in a chair and look at an image of a red hot air balloon soaring through green fields. The woman smiles a lot and while Maggie stares at the balloon, I read her name badge says Becky. Becky tells Mama some things and we follow her out of the room down a long white hallway with wooden doors on either side of us. She flicks a few colorful plastic flags posted above the door before letting us in.\r\n\r\nI take a seat in the big, black, leather chair. I sink back in it. The room is cold and smells too clean. Mama and Maggie sit in green cloth covered chairs. The same one from the waiting room. I notice a mirror. Becky comes back in. She takes a seat on the stool across from me. I am handed a little wooden spoon which I use to cover my left eye and the lights click off. Becky shows me a chart of letters. She instructs me to read the last line I can. I am desperate to pass the test. I mumble out: M, P, Q, Z? The last letter is certainly questionable. Becky just smiles and has me switch the spoon to my other eye. I repeat the test. But now I’m not so sure on the Q, too. \r\n\r\nBecky just smiles again and tells me this machine will help me do better. I lean forward against the black alien contraption with hundreds of little lenses. Becky is right. She has me select from two different options, but with each click the letters become clearer. I hear her say to my mother that I will need glasses. She tells me that it’s time to “dilate my eyes.” My heart begins to race as Mama stands and holds my hand. Becky tells me to hold open my eyes and look directly up. The first drop hits like acid. I scream. Maggie screams and jumps up. I can see her rushing to me. Becky says, “We have to do three more.” I demand to know why to which she replies, “It’s because you have such dark eyes, sweetie.”\r\n\r\nI don’t want to be her sweetie. Each drop feels like salt and chlorine from the pool is rushing in and burning my eyes. Maggie is thoroughly freaked out and Mama is trying to convince her to be brave. I dab at my eyes with the provided tissues. I feel better. Maggie takes her seat and completes the same ritual I did with Becky. When I spin to look at the mirror beside me I realize I can see the letters clearly. The Q was an O and the Z was a T. I feel like a fool. Becky has Maggie and I switch seats because the doctor will be in soon. \r\n\r\nOnce Becky is gone, Mama tells Maggie and me that we were so brave. Maggie’s eyes are red and her pupils are huge. We stand and giggle at each other while Mama watches. There comes a little knock on the door and the giggles subside. I diligently take my seat. The woman who walks in is the woman from my dreams. I have to stumble to pick my jaw up from the floor. She sits on Becky’s stool. She wheels over and intrudes herself as Doctor Yang. I mumble out my name and she smiles that same crinkly eyed smile from my dream. She leans forward and tells me to do the same. A bright light hits my eyes. She tells me to look at her earring. It’s a little pearl. With her this close I can smell the almonds again. I concentrate on her earring as she concentrates on my eye.The woman’s long fingers brush a lock of my hair from my eye. As instructed I look up, down, left, and right with my left eye. Then, I repeat the process with my left. Maggie takes her turn. I wonder if she feels as connected to Dr. Yang as I do. Probably not because Mama says Maggie and I have different birth mothers. Dr. Yang is not her birth mother. She is mine. Mama talks with Dr. Yang for a while and we walk back to the waiting room. “I’ll see you soon,” says Dr. Yang. I nod and smile as I do my best to memorize her soothing voice. \r\n\r\nMama takes us to a man with curly brown hair and square glasses. He sits at a glass table and welcomes us as we approach. Mama hands him two pieces of paper and instructs Maggie and me to “take a look around!” Maggie and I gaze at the colorful frames like kids in a candy shop. We try on red ones, black ones, blue ones, and purple ones. Some frames are square, others are round, and a few are oval. Our noses crinkle at the clear plastic part of a handful of frames that pinch slightly. Some grams don’t have that feature. Maggie settles on a blue square frame and I choose a pink rounded square frame. Out of the corner of my eye I see Dr. Yang. I wonder if I ran to her now if she could answer my questions. Since it’s no longer a dream. But she walks briskly to one of the doors and shuts it behind herself. Maggie and I stare at ourselves and each other in the mirror. Our pupils look like they came off our stuffed animals. Our little eyes are now so big. Mama hands over her credit card and we bounce away with the promise to return soon to pick up our glasses. \r\n\r\nOutside the office, the indoor water feature rushes around. As we step closer, I inhale the pungent scent of chlorine and cringe. But Maggie is ever fearless. She boldly skips over to the big, square bowl and takes a seat on the tiled edge. Her little feet dangle and graze the tile floor as her fingers reach for the water. “It’s cold,” she says as Mama digs in her worn, red wallet and hands her a penny. She gives me one, too. It’s cold in my hand and I know if I bring it to my lips for a kiss for good luck, it’ll smell metallicy. The water rushes louder beside me. I want to burst back into the office and throw my arms around Dr. Yang. I need to apologize for not trusting her last night. But will she take me away from Mama? “Make a wish and toss the penny in the fountain,” says Mama. I squeeze my eyes shut and wish to stay with mama. \r\n\r\n', 'I stand in a perfectly pristine kitchen. The counter tops are covered in flour.

(38, 28, 'Vino Vendetta', 'I had never attended a wine tasting before. Thankfully, my wife knows of these things, and readily agreed when our neighbor, Teresa, invited us to the annual gala at her golf club. She promised it would be quite an experience. Her enthusiasm meant little to me as I had no frame of reference, although I relished the opportunity to taste some potentially excellent wine.\r\n\r\nDozens of circular tables filled the ballroom, and the seating was unreserved. We had just settled down when Teresa let out a groan.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no. It’s ‘the Don.’ Salvo Lombardi. Our resident godfather of wine snobbery. Watch out, he may offer you a wine you cannot refuse.”\r\n\r\nI turned to see a suave, silver-haired gentleman making his way through the crowd. He dispensed nods and waves like a benevolent king bestowing favors on his adoring subjects as he meandered toward our table.\r\n\r\nHe sat down and sized up our group; the corners of his mouth curled up with a slight sneer. He acknowledged fellow club members, Teresa and Bill, and then we introduced ourselves all around.\r\n\r\n“I hope you brought your checkbooks,” the Don said. “It’s essential to keep your cellar well-stocked. I can make a few suggestions if you like.”\r\n\r\nTo kick off the evening’s activities, Chef Philippe came out from the kitchen and briefly described each course he had prepared for us. Before departing, Chef commented on Mr. Salvo Lombardi’s extensive knowledge of wines, and thanked him for his excellent suggestions on tonight’s selection. The Don accepted these accolades with a regal wave of his hand. Soon thereafter the servers began circulating among the tables.\r\n\r\nOur first course comprised smoked salmon on toast points with a sparkling Chardonnay. Salvo instructed us on how to appreciate the fruity yet refreshing taste. We learned that, when aged in oak barrels, the wine developed a creamy, buttery taste with hints of vanilla and spice.\r\n\r\nThat was the magic of wine, like a wizard that could transform itself into many forms. I was thoroughly impressed. It was a tremendous responsibility for the humble grape to carry around.\r\n\r\nThe Don swiveled in this chair and conferred a friendly smile upon me. “You must be new to the club. I don’t recall seeing you before.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not a member,” I said. “We’re here with the Bronsons.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, then you must belong to another club. Which one? I belong to several myself.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t play golf, so I don’t belong to any club. We’re just visiting.”\r\n\r\nThe Don immediately turned to speak to the person on his left. Suddenly, there was a distinct chill in the air. As it transpired, and although we sat shoulder to shoulder, we never exchanged another word the entire evening.\r\n\r\nThe message was obvious: one should never venture above one’s station in life.\r\n\r\nNext up, a creamy asparagus soup served with a chilled Sercial Madeira. Of course, Salvo let us know how difficult it was to pair asparagus with the proper wine, but never fear. He sallied forth to the chef’s rescue toute de suite.\r\n\r\nThe main course was a mouth-watering prime rib paired with a dark Cabernet Sauvignon. The Don demonstrated he had a nose for good wine. We all looked expectantly at Salvo as he swirled the wine and sniffed the aroma, then held it aloft allowing light to filter through to assess its consistency. Finally, he tipped the glass to savor that first sip.\r\n\r\nWe let out a collective sigh of admiration as the Don pronounced it “full bodied with a medium level of acidity, and just about acceptable.”\r\n\r\nI poked my wife sitting next to me. “What the hell does ‘full body’ mean?”\r\n\r\nShe leaned over and whispered, “Think of body as the difference between skim milk, whole milk, and cream. Body is how the wine delights the palate.”\r\n\r\n“Ah-ha!” I was starting to understand. I, too, could learn to be a wine snob.\r\n\r\nDinner progressed, and the cuisine was surprisingly filling despite the miniscule portions. To my untutored taste, I found the wine selection perfectly suited to the particular dish, but what did I know?\r\n\r\nWith each course, the Don pontificated at length on the wine of choice. He was quite the connoisseur, having returned from a recent buying trip in Europe where, he informed us, he’d acquired over three dozen cases of various wines. He expounded on each serving in minute detail, such as the region where it originated, and why that particular climate and soil were uniquely suited to that particular wine and no other.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of wine increased tenfold in one evening. I almost enjoyed listening to the Don drone on and on. . .and on.\r\n\r\nAs an after-dinner digestive, we savored a Cockburn 20-year-old Tawny port served with squares of dark chocolate. Of course, Salvo had to deconstruct the rich, complex taste for us with its layers of caramel, walnuts, butterscotch, and honey. Alas, where would we be without the Don?\r\n\r\nLater, as we prepared to leave, good old, friendly Salvo bid everyone good night. Everyone, except for yours truly. But I’m not one to stand on ceremony and ignored the snub.\r\n\r\nThe warm spring air was refreshing, and together, our little group strolled around the clubhouse before we departed.\r\n\r\nWith a hint of mockery, Teresa inquired whether I’d consider coming back next year.\r\n\r\n“But of course! Who could resist? Besides, the Don and I have so much not to talk about.”\r\n\r\nTerry Adcock © 2022\r\n\r\nAuthor Notes: I\'d welcome any comments or observations.

I think I managed to get a few hellos out but nothing more than that.\r\n\r\nThe next time I met her was on the 31st of October. To be honest I don’t really remember that night much since I was black out drunk for the majority of it.

There are quite a few people in our friends group, I couldn’t quite explain why.

(44, 39, 'Cigarettes: A Romance', 'I remember our first cigarettes together were Rothmans, middle tar, with a filter, of course. It was ten o’clock on a Saturday night and we were attending a local church’s youth club disco. I recall that she’d gone outside for a breath of air.\r\n\r\nGod, I could do with a gasper, she’d said, avoiding my gaze, as if we were on stage and I’d forgotten my lines while searching for a prop. \r\n\r\nI groped around inside my jacket for my pack of Rothmans. My awkward fumbling attracted her attention, and she smiled as I raised my head. She moved closer and caught my eye as I flipped the lid to reveal a double row of cigarettes, lined up like coffin nails wrapped in silver paper. \r\n\r\nDo you have the convenience of a light? She’d asked, helping herself.\r\n\r\nNo, I don’t, I said, clenching a cigarette between my lips, and turning my pockets inside out to show my lack of a handy incendiary.\r\n\r\nTypical, she said, rolling her eyes and leaning towards me.\r\n\r\nMy jaw all but fell open as she raised her slender hand toward my face.\r\n\r\nNever mind, she said, I’ll improvise. Her out-stretched thumb and forefinger plucked the smouldering cigarette from my dry lips. The manoeuvre was gentle but precise and practiced, as if she was removing a milk tooth from under a sleeping infant’s pillow. Her studied gesture was one of ritual, full of expectation, belief and mystery. She was both a nocturnal light-fingered fairy with a delicate touch, and a kind spirit exchanging a child’s fang for a silver sixpence. My cigarette, now resting between my lips again, took on an unearthly quality, blessed by her soft caress. I watched her drawing the smoke into her lungs. The world stopped spinning, and I felt dizzy, waiting for her to exhale. \r\n\r\nI needed that; she said, allowing the white plume to drift over her shoulder. \r\n\r\nI’m Virginia, by the way.\r\n\r\nI returned her smile as my face blanched, the smoke having gone down the wrong way.\r\n\r\nDon’t forget to breathe out, she said, grinning, or you’ll die coughing. \r\n\r\nAt that moment, I was hooked.\r\n\r\nI’ve given up smoking a thousand times; it’s easy. No, really, it is, I promise. It’s a question of perseverance; I don’t mind and they don’t matter. That’s what they say, isn’t it? In the past, I stopped smoking for days, and often as long as a week. When we were young, there was no reason to cease. Besides, after years of dedication, it was easier to continue than to quit.\r\n\r\nWhen Virginia died, I was bereft. She made me promise to quit when I was by her bedside. I visited her in hospital and she had tubes everywhere and an oxygen mask, which she removed from time to time to have a quick puff. She’d insist on me pushing her wheelchair outside for a breath of fresh air. Once we were away from the matron’s watchful glare, she’d rifle through my pockets, spark up and have a good wheeze and cough. Virginia smoked until the last few hours of her life. She was ever faithful to the pleasure that killed her. We’d had fifty years of marriage, golden years and many, many happy times and no regrets.\r\n\r\nI’d never smoked much before I met Virginia; well not every day, anyway. All my pals smoked, and I’d tried it with little success. They told me it was what adults did and I ought to try harder. I persevered until I reckoned I’d got the hang of it. \r\n\r\n‘Gaspers’, she used to call them. Can I nick a gasper? she’d ask, when we got to know one another. She smoked Benson and Hedges and I soon changed my allegiance. It was easier if we both smoked the same brand.\r\n\r\nThe night we met, I’d marched into a local tobacconist clutching the correct money in coins and asked for a pack of twenty. It was my first packet of twenty and I only bought them to feel grown up. I didn’t even have money for a lighter. I had to ask someone for a match to light the one I was holding when she spoke to me. Virginia had caught my eye about town and I’d seen her smoking. I thought I could impress her if I smoked too. If she encouraged me to smoke in the first place, it seemed fitting that she should ask me to stop after her departure.\r\n\r\nWhile sharing a cigarette, we fixed all our problems together. Whatever came our way, we would fight it until the end. We were invincible as a couple and inseparable too; a match made in heaven. Virginia and I laughed our way through life’s troubles. We never argued until we tried to give up smoking at the same time. I’d had a health scare, and she suggested packing it in. Going cold turkey together is awful, and we almost ended our relationship in divorce. After a week, I’d had enough of a respite and started smoking again. I was soon on top form and felt fit again. The breather restored my health, and we returned to our old ways soon after. \r\n\r\nBut what about the expense, I hear you say? It’s funny how you can always find money for cigarettes when you’re a smoker. It doesn’t matter how tough things are, you can buy another pack. My Uncle Jim was a big smoker in the nineteen-seventies. He enjoyed anywhere between thirty to forty cigarettes every day. It was an era when smoking was encouraged and tobacco companies offered many incentives. They gave tokens away with every packet. The idea was to collect them and choose gifts in exchange. Uncle Jim collected seven thousand cigarette tokens of various denominations, hoping to claim a new car. He counted them out, gathered them up in a dozen boxes, and sent them off. It’s funny, but he heard nothing back from the cigarette company. When he called them, they said the tokens must have got lost in the post. Uncle Jim couldn’t believe it. According to my aunt, he hurled the telephone through their enormous picture window. The loss didn’t deter Uncle Jim, however, and he continued to smoke an alternative brand of tobacco. \r\n\r\nI overheard my family discussing the issue, and they asked the inevitable question regarding his expenditure. What would Uncle Jim do with the money if he had it all again? Uncle Jim just shrugged and said, if he had all the money he’d spent on cigarettes, he’d spend it all on cigarettes. \r\n\r\nIt made little sense to me as a youngster and the waste horrified me. Now, I’m not so sure. He enjoyed a cigarette and I can understand that up to a point. He didn’t die of cigarettes and he had a happy life. As a social shorthand, it’s great for making friends. Can I pinch a ciggy? Would you like one of mine? Have you got a light? Inevitably, such questions lead to longer conversations at work or at a party. I’ve made many friends and acquaintances in that way.\r\n\r\nWhen Virginia got ill and had to rest in the hospital, I rationed myself to fourteen cigarettes a week. Two every day; one in the morning and the other in the evening. Some days I’d get to half past ten, and I’d allow myself the second cigarette. Then, by lunchtime, I’d struggle not to have a third. Most days I’d finish ten cigarettes by mid-afternoon and pretend I’d done well. After all, I could have smoked a pack of twenty with ease. In the evening, I’d buy more for the next day and smoke them by the end of the night.\r\n\r\nDuring my last visit to the hospital, Virginia asked me in a whisper if I had a light.\r\n\r\nI’m sorry, love, I said, biting my lip as my eyes burned with salty tears. \r\n\r\nI haven’t got a light; I said. Didn’t you know I’ve given up?\r\n\r\nTypical, she said, her voice rasping behind the oxygen mask. I’ll have to improvise.\r\n\r\nAlmost a year has passed since she made me promise to stop with her last gasp.\r\n\r\nI’ve kept my promise for eleven months, three weeks and four and a half days. \r\n\r\nJust thinking about our life together makes me miss her so much.\r\n\r\nIt’s difficult to forego the two most precious things in one’s life.\r\n\r\nLosing them both at the same time is heart breaking.\r\n\r\nVirginia and cigarettes go together.\r\n\r\nIn my mind, I can’t separate them.\r\n\r\nGod, I could do with one now.', 'I remember our first cigarettes together were Rothmans, middle tar, with a filter, of course. It was ten o’clock on a Saturday night and we were attending a local church’s youth club disco. I recall that she’d gone outside for a breath of air.\r\n\r\nGod, I could do with a gasper, she’d said, avoiding my gaze, as if we were on stage and I’d forgotten my lines while searching for a prop. \r\n\r\nI groped around inside my jacket for my pack of Rothmans. My awkward fumbling attracted her attention, and she smiled as I raised my head. She moved closer and caught my eye as I flipped the lid to reveal a double row of cigarettes, lined up like coffin nails wrapped in silver paper.

(54, 43, 'Sweet Tooth', 'Martha and James have been looking for a new apartment for the last few months. The housing market is outrageous right now and prices for rent, and mortgage are through the roof which has made this whole experience for them feel like an impossible task.\r\n\r\nMartha is a newly graduated nurse who just landed her dream job in the Emergency department at St. Theresa\'s Hospital which is an inner-city hospital that receives all the high-level traumas within the city. She wants to get all the best experience and to establish herself as a competent trauma nurse. This new job however is hours away from where her and James currently live and requires them to move closer into the city. This is not too much of an issue for James. James is a photographer and works for himself and sees moving to the city as an opportunity to bring in more clients since work has been slow lately.\r\n\r\n“James; I don’t know how we are going to find anything nearby the hospital” Martha expresses with frustration.\r\n\r\nJames responds trying to be as positive as he can. “I know it is difficult but there has to be something out there that we can afford. Even if it is something temporary until we build up some extra cash.”\r\n\r\nThe couple’s finances are a tight right now which is greatly limiting their options. It is important they move within a reasonable distance to the city for Martha to be able to commute to and from work safely. She is going to be working 12 hour shifts and the commute time before and after her shifts is something she needs to take into consideration when looking for a place for them to live. The couple has scoured endless amounts of realtor websites and apps. They have called local realtor companies and toured countless homes and apartments that are all far more expensive than they can manage to pay.\r\n\r\n“There is an apartment for rent on craigslist that I found, it is a one bedroom one bath. It is 850 square foot space which is kind of smaller than we were hoping, but it has a storage unit we could use.” James continues “The neighborhood doesn’t seem too bad, and the commute would be about forty-five minutes from the hospital.”\r\n\r\nMartha leans over James’ shoulder to get a look at the computer. “Well, it is pretty ugly, and we would have to see if they would let us at least paint the walls, but I have to start my new job soon and it is getting to a point where beggars can’t be choosers. Did they say how much it costs?”\r\n\r\nJames replies “No, but they say call for inquiries. We could just call and go from there.”\r\n\r\nMartha slides James’ cell phone over to him. “Can you call them? You know I hate calling and talking to people.”\r\n\r\nHe chuckles as he picks up his phone. “Chicken shit, aren’t you supposed to be an adult?” He grins as he pokes fun at her inability to call people and have a conversation.\r\n\r\nShe reaches her hand back and gives James a soft smack on the back of his head. “Just call you idiot.”\r\n\r\nJames continues to laugh as he rubs the back of his head. “Alright, Alright! The abuse I have to suffer for your love.”\r\n\r\nHe dials the number listed in the craigslist ad. The phone rings a few times and a mans voice answers in a flat tone. “Hello…”\r\n\r\n“Hi, my name is James. I saw your ad on craigslist for the apartment and I was wondering if it is still available?”\r\n\r\n“It is… would you like to come take a look at it” The man on the other end of the phone speaks in an almost monotone voice. Barely sounds like this man is interested in having this conversation.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my wife and I have some free time this afternoon if that works for you. Could we swing by around maybe five o’clock tonight and check it out?”\r\n\r\nThe man on the phone slightly coughs to clear his throat and begins to sound a little more enthusiastic in his response. “Of course, James was it? You and your wife are more than welcome to come take a look at the apartment. I will make myself available. The address is listed in the advertisement. If you need to cancel, please call back and leave me a message.”  \r\n\r\nThe man on the phone ends the call. James looks over to Martha. “Well, we have an appointment with the guy at five” He enters the address from the craigslist ad into the GPS on his phone. “Looks like the address is about an hour and a half away. We should probably get going soon so we can be there on time. Maybe a little early and drive through the neighborhood first to check it out.”\r\n\r\n“Sure…” Martha responds. “I am just going to toss on some clean clothes and pour some coffee and we can go. Maybe we can see if there is somewhere nearby on the way back where we can grab some dinner.”\r\n\r\nJames slaps his thighs with his hands “Sounds like a good plan to me!”\r\n\r\nMartha and James grab their phones and wallets and head out to go check out the apartment. The drive there is rather uneventful. They haven’t been to this town before so the decided to head over and get there slightly early so they could make sure this apartment wasn’t smack dab in the middle of the ghetto. They were desperate for an apartment but weren’t exactly looking to live in a bad neighborhood either.\r\n\r\nGetting closer to their destination they are slightly early to their appointment, so they continue with their plan and drive around the area to check everything out. Surprisingly enough there aren’t a ton of homes in the area. No apartment buildings just single-family homes and multifamily homes spread out through the area. A decent amount of privacy as well in between the properties with every home sitting on about an acre of land with plenty of trees separating most of the property lines. It is quite a beautiful area.\r\n\r\nMartha’s excitement quickly begins to disappear as her and James drive around the local neighborhoods. “James, I know this apartment is small but this area seems pretty nice, I highly doubt we are going to be able to afford this place.”\r\n\r\nJames trying to stay positive responds “It’s okay babe. Let’s just check the place out and hear what the guy is asking for in price. We desperately need a place closer to the hospital and once you bring in a couple checks and I get established and take on more clients we should be fine. If we like the place we can make it work. It is only 45 minutes away from the hospital and I doubt we are going to find anything closer to the city within our price range.”\r\n\r\nMartha sighs “Okay” She is anxious. She has dreamed of becoming a nurse in the Emergency Room the entire time she was in nursing school. They allowed her to shadow a nurse for a day while she was in clinicals. Some of the other girls in class before her did not like that day long rotation in the emergency department. The department is often chaotic with a hundred things happening at once. Martha was motivated by that excitement; a baby being born in one bed with another person receiving CPR just on the other side of the curtain. She want’s to be where the action is and making getting this apartment is what is going to get her there.\r\n\r\nThey proceed to the address from the craigslist ad and arrive a few minutes early. James parks the car in front of the building. It appears to be a multi-family home with an overgrown lawn. A few newspapers lay out in the front yard; some appear to have been there for a while. Martha and James exchange smiles with one another and exit the car. They make it to the front door and knock. A man’s voice from the other side of the door yells “Come on in! The door is unlocked.”\r\n\r\nThey open the door and walk through into a foyer. There is a coat rack on the wall to the right and just a few feet further are a set of stairs that lead up to a second floor. To the left of the stairwell there are two closed doors. One probably being the entrance to the bottom floor residence of the building. The door opens and a man stands in the doorway. Obscured by shadow it is hard to get a good look at him. “Hello, my name is Rocco, I am the one you spoke with. The unit is the upstairs; would you like me to show you around?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, we would love that!” Martha responds\r\n\r\nRocco gestures towards the stairs “Alright if you could close the door behind you we can go take a peak at the place.”\r\n\r\nJames closes the door behind him and Martha and begin to follow Rocco up the flight of stairs. Rocco leads them up the flight of stairs, opens the door to the apartment and walks through the door. As James and Martha follow in behind him Rocco flicks a light on into the apartment. They get a decent look at the man. He stands at an average height probably around 5’10. He looks like he is roughly late fifties early sixties as far as age goes but who can tell. His head is shaved bald and has a clean-shaven face. His skin is pale gray like they guy has never spent more than half a minute outside before. His eyes appear sunken as if he hadn’t slept in a while.\r\n\r\n So far things look just like the photos they saw online. It is an unfinished apartment with a large room that is likely to be used as the living room, a small kitchen but it has all your basic needs such as a fridge, oven and stove, some cabinets, a small dishwasher, and a single basin sink. There is a small hallway that turns right and leads to two doors. There is a bathroom just off to the left, it is small but functional with a full bathtub and shower. At the end of the hall is the bedroom. Probably large enough for a queen size mattress and maybe one end table.\r\n\r\nMartha turns to Rocco and asks “Sir, thank you for allowing us to check the place out. I have to ask; how much are you charging for rent?”\r\n\r\nThe man begins to smile. Making eye contact with Martha he responds “Right now I am offering to rent this place out for twelve hundred dollars a month. Water and electricity included.”\r\n\r\nMartha and James exchange looks with one another. “In today’s market that seems quite cheap for a place that’s located next to a major highway that leads directly into the city. We have looked at other places similar in size with rent costs as high as eighteen hundred per month without included utilities. Is there something we should know about this place?”\r\n\r\nRocco begins to respond to James but continues to keep his eyes on Martha. “I own this place outright and I am not burdened by the debt of the building. I have no need to drive up the cost. I could just use the extra income to aid in some home repairs and yard maintenance.” Rocco continues “There is also a basement that can be used for an ample amount of storage. I do not have much down there. If you would like I could step out for a moment while you two discuss?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, please that would be very kind of you.” Martha responds.\r\n\r\nRocco exits the unit and closes the door behind him to allow the couple to talk. James asks, “So babe… what do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, the price is nice. A forty-five-minute commute to and from work doesn’t sound too bad. We still need to look at the storage, but I think this might be the best option for now. At least until the market drops again and we can afford something a little bit better.” Martha pauses for a moment. “Does the landlord give off weird vibes to you?”\r\n\r\nJames shrugs “No I haven’t really noticed anything out of the ordinary. He just seems like some old man.”\r\n\r\nMartha wants the apartment but something about the landlord is giving her some doubt. “Okay well let’s check out the basement and then head back home and we can sleep on it and see how we feel tomorrow about it. If we still want to go through with it, we can call him back and make this happen.”\r\n\r\nThe couple exit the apartment and make their way down the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs the look to the right an see the door that leads to the basement. James calls out for Rocco “Hey Rocco, is it okay if we go check the basement?”\r\n\r\nRocco calls out from the darkness of the open doorway he came out from earlier “Be my guest! The door is unlocked.”\r\n\r\nJames walks through first. He reaches for a light switch located on the wall to the right and flicks it to the on position. No light turns on. James is ready to get this over with and reaches in his pocket to pull out his phone and use its flashlight. He turns on the flashlight and begins to lead Martha down the stairs into the basement. They get to the bottom of the stairs and the door at the top of the steps slams with a strong force. This startles Martha and she falls down the remaining stairs taking James with her.\r\n\r\nMartha hears a loud crashing noise hit the ground below her. She was lying on top of James and he wasn’t moving, Martha becomes overwhelmed with panic. “James! James!” she shouts. The flashlight on his phone must have broke or turned off because it was pitch black in the basement. Martha continues “James! Say something!” Still nothing. James motionless body lies on the floor. She reaches her hands down to start feeling around. She reaches for James’s head and feels a hot pool of liquid on the floor which she assumes is blood. She screams at the top of her lungs “HELP!”\r\n\r\nMartha springs up and finds the stairs again in the pitch-black basement. She sprints up the stairs as fast as she can and attempts to open the door. The door wont budge and she begins slamming the door as hard as she can with both of her fists. Screaming for help from anyone who will hear. She stops screaming to take a breath for a moment. She is completely overwhelmed with fear and has tired herself out. She hears a creaking noise on one of the steps behind her. She turns “James?” She barely gets the word out before an something with overwhelming strength grabs her by the hair and violently pulls her down the stairs.\r\n\r\nKicking and screaming the whole way down the stairs she is dragged all the way down back onto the cool basement floor. Struggling to break free from the unknown assailants grasp but it seems to be of no use. “What do you want?! Who are you?! Please let me go!” Martha begins to plead with her attacker. She feels a heavy weight pin down her hips as if someone were sitting on top of her. Her arms are pinned to the floor over her head.\r\n\r\nMartha now immobile being held down by immense strength Martha pleads once again to her attacker frightened voice “Please, why are you doing this?” Martha staring up into the darkness towards the unknown attacker. Martha’s heart is beating so hard she can feel her eardrums pulsating as she lies there helpless. Two gold circles become visible in the darkness as the attackers eyes begin to glow.\r\n\r\nA cold dull voice responds “Because frightened little girls taste the sweetest\"', 'Martha and James have been looking for a new apartment for the last few months.

(55, 44, 'There is no I in Scream', 'The memo goes out a month after I join EasyCo: everybody must attend the team-building exercises. I must remember to bring my opener. My group includes Jaden, also a new hire. He’s cute in a J.Crew unstained T-shirt kind of way.\r\n\r\nSix big sleek buses trundle us out to a rustic hideaway, a monster log cabin where we assemble in the frigid air conditioning. Perch on chair-sized wooden cubes, we watch the opening ceremonies. “It takes teamwork to make the dream work! People are our most important asset!”\r\n\r\nPeople are our most important resource! Get out of your comfort zone! Don’t ASSUME, it makes an ASS of U and ME. Work smarter, not harder! It takes teamwork to make the dream work!\r\n\r\nI slink off to the peanut gallery, where Jaden sees me and points to the cube beside him.\r\n\r\n“There is no I in team!” the announcer says below.\r\n\r\n“There is no I in psychopath,” I say.\r\n\r\nJaden swallows a laugh. “Smartass Karla.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard it all before,” I say. This is my third team-building exercise this year, but I decide not to share this with Jaden.\r\n\r\n“You ready for some fun?” With a half-smile, he looks me up and down, making clear the kind of fun he has in mind.\r\n\r\nMy opener is warm in my pink purse, gently bumping against me. I give a long, slow blink.\r\n\r\nAfter the speeches, we eat five-star fusion, then get chased outside to experience Nature, red in tooth and claw. Soon, it’s time to climb the mountain, which is actually an off-season ski run. Loudspeakers blare Climb Every Mountain.\r\n\r\n“Better travel light,” Jaden says, motioning for me to leave my handbag behind, stash it in a locker.\r\n\r\n“Nope,” I say, moving it front and center, where it’s as pink and dangly as a uvula. Lipstick, cell phone, and my little Swiss Army friend tucked inside. Tulli, I call her. “It helps to bring an opener,” I tell Jaden.\r\n\r\n*       *       *\r\nWhen I was in grade school, I used to get chased mercilessly at recess. One time I found Tulli stuck into the ground under the shrubs where I was hiding. I wiped her blade off, folded her up, and took her home. I found her useful for carving. Wood, ice, flesh: all manner of things. Bonding ensued. Tulli has several useful appendages. I called them openers because they could open all sorts of things—cans, bottles, arteries. Nobody minds when you say you carry “an opener” in your Hello Kitty pencil case.\r\n\r\n*       *       *\r\nThe keynote speech by the EasyCo top brass is all about “transforming our tomorrows” or, as Jaden calls it, “fucking up our futures.” Afterward, their minions hand out maps. “Here’s the way up Mount Success,” the organizer says, “then we’ll do team building on the cliff. See you there in an hour.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve got an hour,” Jaden says to me. “A lot can happen in an hour.”\r\n\r\n“You bet,” I say, smiling, touching my purse. “I’d like to transform your tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Ever been lost in the woods?” His smile grows wider.\r\n\r\n“All the time,” I say.\r\n\r\nThe group begins to climb, in twos and threes. Jaden and I are joined by Fred, the guy who hired us. Fred has three kids and nightmares about losing his house. He also has a growth on his eyebrow, a purple wart, that makes Tulli grow warm. Another time, I promise her.\r\n\r\n“We need to practice team building,” Fred says. “With all the turnover this year, it’s just been one team dismantling after another.”\r\n\r\n“What, exactly, is team building?” Jaden asks Fred as he climbs over a fallen tree in our path.\r\n\r\n“Take people out of their comfort zone,” Fred says, puffing a little with the effort to follow Jaden, “give them a task to do, and voilà! Team building!”\r\n\r\n“Or team dismemberment,” I say. Everybody laughs.\r\n\r\n*       *       *\r\nIt’s a tough climb. Around me, people mutter. They call it a hike, a trek, a portage. An adventure. I call it running out on the landlord the day before rent’s due.\r\n\r\nThat last time was maybe the worst. We were living right on the outskirts of town. Beyond the mega mall, beyond the trailer park. My stepdad used his belt to make us move faster. Ma said not to run along the tracks but he said that’s the easiest. “Stop your fretting, woman. We will know if the train is coming—in plenty of time.” And my stepdad was right: we did hear the train. We heard it when we were way out on the trestle bridge. Too bad there wasn’t room for all of us on the side-step platform.\r\n\r\nThere is no I in scream.\r\n\r\n*       *       *\r\nFred wanders off, his footwear a problem, while Jaden and I practice heavy breathing. At a shady spot, we sit down. “So how about that opener?” Jaden says, his eyes traveling over my breasts. He pulls a ginger beer from his backpack. “D’you think there’ll be a party afterward?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe there’s a picnic on the cliff,” I say.\r\n\r\nPicnic, he repeats, laughing. “Picnic,” he says in a Kermit voice. He slips his fingers under my T-shirt—and then out again.\r\n\r\nThe places where they have been are starting to tingle. I feel extra-alert now. “We could try the opener right now,” I say, my hand touching his forearm. Nice veins.\r\n\r\nBehind us is the steady tramp-tramp of co-workers.\r\n\r\n“Do you think we can make it on time?” Fred calls as he approaches.\r\n\r\nJaden starts big-stepping on the path, chuckling as he leaves me behind. “I’m a champion climber,” he says.\r\n\r\n“We don’t want a team of champions—we want a champion team,” Fred says in a fake jolly voice. Another pearl of wisdom from the keynote.\r\n\r\nJaden shoots me a look and I try not to laugh.\r\n\r\n“Oh no, my bootlace broke,” I say. “Save a spot for me up there, Fred, will you?” I stare into his face, yearning to do something with that purple wart. Another time, I think.\r\n\r\nA solemn look crosses Fred’s face, as if I have just revealed the secret, special mission that only he can do. “You betcha,” he says, voice husky.\r\n\r\nHe turns his back to me and leaves.\r\n\r\nJaden comes close and presses a fleeting kiss on the side of my neck. I lean into him and his fingers slide back to where they oughtn’t be. “Do you need your bootlace re-threaded?” he murmurs in my ear. I nod. He looks left, right: no co-workers. “Shoot, we are real slowpokes,” he drawls.\r\n\r\nI sit down on the springy earth, pulling him with me. “Well then, let’s fix this bootlace proper.”\r\n\r\n*       *       *\r\nI feel Jaden’s excitement. He is so warm and willing. I have the urge to fondle Tulli so, with my free hand, I slip her out of my purse.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day we’ve been promised a “personal share” time. Something my new co-workers will learn about me is that I love tools. There’s great beauty in tools. They are well-proportioned. Purpose-built. As hard and smooth as a gymnast’s thighs. Always ready to be deployed.\r\n\r\n*       *       *\r\nI turn up two hours late to the team-building exercise. There’s already a line-up for the diving board where you jump into a mosh pit. The loudspeaker blares Eye of the Tiger. “No fear,” brays the leader. “Bravery starts here!”\r\n\r\n“Hey, who hasn’t gone yet?” the organizer calls.\r\n\r\nFred starts the chant: Karla! Kar-la! Kar-LAH!\r\n\r\nThe crowd jumbles me forward, propelled like a grenade tossed from hand to hand.\r\n\r\nI climb the ladder, shaky on each rung. It’s not as high as the fire escape at EasyCo where I like to hang out with Tulli. But still.\r\n\r\nI look down.\r\n\r\nIt’s all sedentary office workers below me. No one in the mosh pit has the upper body strength to make this work. It’s stepdad on the trestle bridge all over again. The whistling sound of little Bobby before he made a splash. At the top of the diving board, I listen hard; I can recall the high-pitched scream of the 10:27 that night.

Jaden is splayed out under a shrub halfway down the mountain.\r\n\r\nThat was a lovely time with Jaden. His T-shirt would get very stained. We did the team-builidng exercise, or at least we did the exercise. We pressed together with sweet urgency. Jaden unburdened himself and I took it all in, all the fear, all the glory. When he grew calmer, he said, Maybe we should catch up with the group.\r\n\r\n“Why?” I said, “there is no US in team.”\r\n\r\n“Because,” he said, and then he began to play with my purse, just inches away. “They might need to use your opener,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Good point,” I said.\r\n\r\nAnd when Tulli was done what she had to do, that’s when I rejoined the group. My Swiss Army friend is back in my purse, gently bumping against me.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n', 'The memo goes out a month after I join EasyCo: everybody must attend the team-building exercises.

(56, 45, 'The Man in the Window', '\r\nI knew something was off before I opened my eyes. As I pulled my consciousness up from the depths of my dreamless sleep, I could feel the itchy, foreign clothes on my body. Something wasn’t right. The sensation of a pair of eyes watching me made me shiver and I snapped awake ready to fight. Heart beating fast with adrenaline, I sat up in bed with my hands in front of me, shielding me, but what I saw was even worse.\r\n\r\nThis was not my room. This was not my bed. Those weren’t my windows or my clothes. I didn’t know where I was. I could feel the springs beneath me as I shifted to peer around the room. It was dark apart from the small film of moonlight filtering into the space. The curtains fluttered in a breeze that sent shadows dancing across the wall. Apart from the bed and window, there was nothing, like someone forgot to finish making it. The corners of the room were dark and uninviting, but so dark that it seemed unnatural with the moonlight that scattered through. My mind marked the absence of a door and saved it for later as I examined the wall behind me. It was blank like everything else in the room, that feeling of unfinishedness settling in next to my fear. I pulled back the thin, hospital-like sheets and examined my clothing. The idea that someone else had dressed me while I slept made me shiver, and the feeling of being watched fell over me again. I snapped my eyes up to search the room but all I saw was the window.\r\n\r\nA window. I sprung out of bed and began to run for the window when I felt a tug on my ankle and I threw my hands in front of me as I fell face-first into the floor. Nose aching, I slowly turned in horror to see a thin band wrapped around my ankle. I trailed the chain as it snaked around the bedpost and mysteriously disappeared under the bed. For a moment, I just sat there, lip trembling, nose bleeding, willing myself not to cry because that would be an admittance of hope lost. I still had hope. Somewhere down there, deep inside me, there had to be a sliver of hope willing itself to peek back out. There had to be.\r\n\r\nAnd it started with finding out how to get my ankle out of its chain. I grabbed it and tugged. The thin band had little to no give and would certainly not slip off my foot. Huffing, I scanned the room once more. No door. No entryway. No sign of an exit other than the unattainable window. \r\n\r\nA single tear escaped down my face when a hand grabbed the edge of the windowsill from the outside. Slowly, their nails scraping against the wood, they inched their face into view. I quickly shuffled backward until my back hit the edge of the bed, sending me jumping on my nerves. \r\n\r\nHe was staring blankly at me, his body contorted into a crouch as he twisted himself through the window. He silently placed himself in front of it, still staring at me with that blank expression while I froze in fear. \r\n\r\nSome people run when they are afraid, but not me, I freeze up and sit in my fear until you can taste it in the air and my muscles are as tense and hard as a tree and I have no hope of ever escaping. So I sit there, staring at this man in front of me as he slowly tilts his head to the side, shifting the rags of clothing that hang loosely from his body. I knew that I would die at some point in my life, but I’d always hoped it would be painless. I was never afraid of death, just the idea that I could die horribly like those women do in documentaries, and I knew I could never withstand pain like that. That I would likely go insane. So I sat there, heart racing, thinking about how I never thought I would die like this and really have no hope of a way out, that there had to be some way out, when he smiled at me. A wide-eyed, thin-lipped, mouth stretched smile that reached his eyes in a psychotic, bone-chilling way that only gave me a glimpse of my horrid future before something took control of me. He began reaching his arm toward me and I don’t know how I did it, but I snapped out of it. The ankle shackle must have been subconsciously running through my brain as I sat there, because the image of it snaking under the bed was the first thing to come to mind, and suddenly I was on my elbows frantically crawling under the bed to find where it went to. \r\n\r\nFirst, I saw where it connected to the wood paneling on the bed, and second, I saw the gaping hole in the bottom of the floor that stole the light. No matter the blown open window letting in the moonlight to my adjusted eyes; the hole was one of pure darkness that light entered and never came out of again. I hesitated for a moment when I felt his dry, cold hands caress my calf and I jumped, banging my head on the bottom of the bed. In that moment, my right hand slipped into the darkness and I lost my balance. An intense cold feeling washed over my arm and I tugged it back quickly in pain. I examined my arm but my skin wasn’t even cold when it returned, so I dipped my fingertip into the hole with hesitation. Just as I touched the surface, his hand gripped my leg and began to yank me backward. The idea that I could not see what he was doing above me sent pangs of undulated fear into my body and I threatened to lock up again, but my mind came back to the man dragging me from under the bed and I knew the hole was my only way out. I kicked my legs as his nails dug into me and I shoved both my arms into the unknown and hoped that I would die a less painful death than the one that awaited me with him. He pulled me harder the farther I reached down, like he was so opposed to me reaching whatever lay at the end of this hole, so I knew it had to be my way out. I threw myself into the darkness with one last push, and his nails left a gash in my calf. I fell out of his grasp and soared into the void as everything dulled around me. \r\n\r\nI floated there in the darkness, devoid of light, sound, touch, taste, or smell, and for a moment, it was nice, but then I began to panic. Against my better judgment, I clawed my way up, like swimming up from the bottom of a pool. A pool so deep I was running out of breath, and when I finally gasped for air, I was sitting up in my bed, hair sweaty, sheets pushed back, heart racing. \r\n\r\nA dream, it was a dream. I slowly laid myself back down and pulled the covers back up, looking around my familiar room to prove to myself that the man never existed and that I was safe. That my fears were so far-fetched that I turned away from the door that haunted me. I often dreamed of a man walking through my door in the middle of the night and taking me, but never my window. As I slowly shifted to face the window, a feeling of aching in my calf started to find me, and my lip felt damp. I reached my hand up to wipe my nose and blood rubbed off onto my fingertips. That feeling of being watched dawned on me, and I pulled my eyes to face the window in horror, coming face to face with the man in the window staring back at me with his wide-eyed grin. I opened my mouth in a silent scream before he grabbed me.', 'I knew something was off before I opened my eyes.

(57, 46, 'Reapers!!', 'I stepped over the mossy log and continued down the hill. The forest was cool, unlike the city, dirty, and full of the smell of dead corpses. The smell of the woods was different, it was fresh, clear, not musty. I spent most of my time in the woods now, staying away from the city as much as possible. \r\n\r\nThe site of the corpses scattered across the city filled me with, anger. None of those people had done anything to deserve this, to be gunned down by the army, then left to rot. They didn’t deserve the Seed either, or the Cycle. But out in the woods, I didn’t have to see any of them. No Reapers stumbling around, no people going through the Cycle. \r\n\r\nI can’t stay in the woods forever though, just to hunt. I must be with Avery, Jenni, and Tessa. They are all I have left, after the Seed.  \r\n\r\n“Give me the beat-Boys and free my soul,” I sang quietly. “I want to get lost in your rock and roll, so drift away!” Singing the chorus of that song brought back the memory of listening to it for hours with my mom. Me and her always loved the same type of music. \r\n\r\nSuddenly, a deer emerged from the brush, silently eating grass. The animal had been left alone for years, that it didn’t even care about me. I squatted down and started to stab my knife in the dirt, watching the deer graze.  \r\n\r\nOccasionally, it would look up at me with its big, brown eyes, then continue to eat. I was jealous of the deer, he was free. Didn’t have to worry about Reapers, or the Seed, anything. Maybe getting mauled by a bear, but nothing really, free of worry. \r\n\r\nI stood up, which made the deer flinch. I sheathed my knife, then walked away. My sudden movement scared the deer away. “Time to get back,” I whispered. Slowly, I made my way back up the hill, the whole-time singing Drift Away, while I could. \r\n\r\n… \r\n\r\nThe sky was grey, the streets were barren, besides the few bodies of Reapers here and there, and some crashed cars. I walked in the middle of the street, hoping to not attract attention from Reapers. When one came, they all came. I’ve only been chased by a horde once, and I wasn’t waiting for that chance again. \r\n\r\nI remember it clearly. It was about two weeks after the Seed hit, and I was scavenging in some Walmart supercenter. I had just filled my bag up when I started hearing moans. They started coming from everywhere, behind cash registers, the bathroom, random aisles. It was a miracle I made it out of there. \r\n\r\nWhen I did escape, they came pouring out the front door, huddling up into a horde. I ran for what seemed like an hour, but it was just a minute at most. The ones from the store plus Reapers from the streets added up to about a hundred Reapers. \r\n\r\nI managed to barricade a close by furniture store, then escape out the back door. I shook my head and tried to forget that day. “Just plain stupid to remember,” I told myself. The low hum of an engine came into my ear. Quickly, I turned around, and just in time to doge the blue Charger barreling after me. \r\n\r\nI rolled into a pile of rubble, but I jumped up quickly. The driver of the car stopped, then leaned out his window. “Stay out of the road, dumb ass!” he shouted. I picked up a rock and hurled it at his car. It shattered the back window. “Yeh, watch where you\'re going, You big sh...” I didn’t finish, the car slowly started rolling backwards. \r\n\r\nQuickly, I turned around and ran. Some survivors were nice, but this guy wasn’t. I heard the engine being revved up and the wheels squealing, then the car took off towards me. My legs were pumping, sweat dripping off my hair. I jumped behind a cement barricade before I became one with the road. \r\n\r\nThe car zoomed right past the barricade, and straight into another. Smoke was rising out of the hood, and liquid was pouring from the bottom. I heard whimpers and screams of pain from the man. I wanted to leave him for dead, but I just couldn’t. I came out from behind the barricade and jogged to the car. \r\n\r\nI came up to the window and looked down at the man. He was in his twenties, slick, blonde hair, blue eyes. “Please,” he begged. “Don’t leave me.” I nodded. “What’s your name?” He coughed hard for a second, then said, “Gavin.” “Okay, Gavin,” I replied. “Are you hurt?”  \r\n\r\nHe nodded. “Can’t... Can’t feel my legs.” I knew then I wouldn’t be able to get him back to the shelter. I tried opening his door, but it was so crushed that it wouldn’t budge. Another sound, besides the broken car, filled my ears. It was the silent, dark moan of the Reapers. \r\n\r\nI looked around. I couldn’t see any, but they were there. “Please don’t leave me,” cried Gavin. I shook my head. “I\'m not going anywhere.” I then started to jerk to what was left of the handle, but it was stuck. I pulled harder, but nothing moved. Gavin started to cry. “It\'s stuck,” I said. “You need to calm down.” \r\n\r\n“Don’t leave me,” he cried. I turned around once more, and sure enough, there were Reapers. Four of them. I couldn’t shoot them, it would just bring more, and it would be a waste of ammo. They limped towards the car slowly. Gavin grabbed my arm. “Please!”  \r\n\r\nI pulled out my Revolver and aimed it at the first Reaper. My finger wouldn’t pull the trigger. I looked down at Gavin, he was a pitiful sight to see. “I\'m sorry,” I whispered, knowing there was absolutely no chance of escape for him, and I shot him. Right int the head, it just took one shot, and he was dead. \r\n\r\nHis body stopped breathing and he went limp. I replaced my gun in its holster, then ran, away from the Reapers and Gavin’s body. I turned around once when I was at a safe distance. There were about ten Reapers now, huddled around the car, ripping chunks from Gavin’s corpse. \r\n\r\n... \r\n\r\n“He came out of nowhere,” I said. “Almost ran me over, but I jumped.” Avery pointed his spoon at me. “And what happened after that?” I shrugged. “I smashed his window with a rock and ran.” Avery dropped the spoon in his clam chowder and started to laugh. \r\n\r\nJenni’s smile grew wider. “You smashed his window,” she asked. “Then ran away.” I nodded, smiling myself. Avery recovered from his laughter, then scooped up the rest of his chowder. Tessa slowly stirred her dinner, watching the steam rise from the bowl. “What happened to him?” she asked. “The man in the car.” I looked at her, my body stiffened. “Umm,” I replied. “He, uh... He drove away.” “Thats it. You smash his window, and he drives away?” Avery questioned. I shook my head. “No, he chased me, but he kept driving,” I lied. “Missed me by an inch.” \r\n\r\nTessa was about to reply when a knock came from the door. I looked at the door, thinking it was just my imagination. Avery looked at the door too, so I knew it was real. Jenni stood up, gripping a steak knife. I pulled out my own knife and slowly advanced towards the door. \r\n\r\nAnother knock came, but this time with a voice. “Hello, is anyone in there?” I took one step closer. “Please, just let me in,” he said. I looked at the door, then reached out for the handle. “Who are you?” I asked. I was answered with another knock. \r\n\r\n“Just let me in!” he cried. “They\'re coming!” I turned the lock, then opened the door. The survivor stumbled in, falling to the floor. I looked out the door before I closed it. Sure enough, the street was full of Reapers, on top of cars, crawling around, everywhere. \r\n\r\nI closed the door, locked it, then looked down at the new man. “Who are you?” I asked. Jenni and Avery walked over from the table, but Tessa stayed there. “Riley... Riley Summers,” the man stammered. I held out my hand, and Riley took it. \r\n\r\n“Who are you guys?” he asked. I pointed towards my friends. “That’s Avery, and Jenni,” I said, then gestured to the table. “And that\'s Tessa, I\'m Noah.” Riley looked over at the table, then back to me. He had eyes like a hungry then. “Food,” he said. “I haven\'t had any in days, please.” Jenni walked back to the table and served Riley a bowl. \r\n\r\nHe scurried over to the table and wolfed down the clam chowder, then he served himself another bowl. While he was eating, the rest of us went into the living room to talk. “He can’t stay here,” said Jenni. I shook my head. “He helpless,” I replied. “Got nowhere to go.”  \r\n\r\nAvery clapped his hands together. “Listen, he can stay until he is ready to set out, then that\'s that,” he said. “Maybe for a week at the most.” I nodded. “Thats fine with me.” Jenni looked at us both, then sighed. “Fine, one week.” \r\n\r\nI turned around and headed back to the kitchen. Riley was talking with Tessa when I sat down. “You can stay,” I said. “For a few days.” Riley took another bite of his chowder, then smiled at me. “Thank you.” \r\n\r\nJenni and Avery came and returned to their seats. I was about to ask Riley a question when I noticed something on his arm: it was a bite mark. I looked up at his eyes. Sure enough, there was red swelling under his eye lids. I didn’t know what to do. Kill him on the spot, kick him out, tell everyone else. For now, I wasn’t going to do anything. \r\n\r\nIn the morning, Riley was gone. Along with some of our food and the hunting rifle. \r\n\r\n... \r\n\r\n“He was infected,” I explained to Tessa. “It was good that he left.” Tessa leaned back into her seat. “Why did he leave though?” she asked. “I mean, he had safety, shelter, anything anyone would want.” I looked over at Jenni, and she just shrugged. \r\n\r\nAvery jumped into the conversation, which I was glad. “Some people just don’t trust everyone, that’s why.” Tessa nodded. I turned the wheel and the car glided to the right. The sky started to grow dark, the sun drifting slowly behind the horizon. \r\n\r\nI pressed harder on the gas pedal. Avery leaned forward from the back seat. “They will be out soon,” he said. I looked at him, then reached down for my water bottle. As I brought my hand back up, the bottle bumped the radio knob, turning the station on. At first, it was just noise, then a voice started talking, clear as day. \r\n\r\n“Turn it up,” Avery said, staring anxiously at the stereo. “This message is... is to all survivors. My name... Kevin Reich,” said the radio. “There is... lifeboat in Newyork harbor. Me... Crew... For as long a... can.” I looked at Jenni, and she stared back with the same look. “We will wait for everyone... that can fit. Go... Bye.” \r\n\r\nAfter those last words, the voice left, and the scratchy noise returned. “Lifeboat,” I whispered. “Newyork?” Jenni reached back and grasped Tessa’s hand. “We\'re gonna be safe?” She asked. I nodded. A smile crossed my face, and hope returned to my heart. \r\n\r\nSuddenly, Tessa screamed. I was so consumed with the thought of freedom; I wasn’t paying attention to the road. “Watch out!” Jenni cried. I didn’t know what to look out for, but I jerked the wheel to the right, then everything went black. \r\n\r\n… \r\n\r\nMy eyes opened slowly. The car had crashed, into a lamppost. Smoke was coming out of the engine, and the window had shattered. I tried to turn to the back, but a sharp pain entered my neck. “Is... Everyone okay?” I managed to say. I heard a faint groan from the back. \r\n\r\nI reached down the unbuckle myself, but I stopped. There was a giant shard of the window glass stuck in my thigh. Blood was steadily dripping off my leg onto the seat. I tried to pull it out, but it hurt too much. So, I unbuckled my seat belt and opened my door. \r\n\r\nI fell onto the floor when I tried to stand up, and the glass sunk deeper into my leg. I wanted to scream in pain, but what I saw next stopped me from it. There was a Reaper in the road, standing about thirty feet away. I rolled over so I could grab my gun. When I pulled it out, I saw the Reaper was getting closer. \r\n\r\nIts jaw had rotted off long ago, same with its hair. I cocked my pistol, then fired off a shot. The bullet hit the Reaper in the stomach, but it kept coming. “Noah!” Avery shouted from the car. “I\'m coming, just hold on.” I took another shot at the Reaper, but it missed. \r\n\r\nI just couldn’t hit its head at the angle I was at. Now it was about ten feet away, step by step it got closer. “Hold on!” Avery said again. I started to lose consciousness; I was losing too much blood. My hand slowly lowered, then I dropped my revolver. My head sagged to the ground. And I was out. The last thing I heard before fainting was three gunshots. \r\n\r\n… \r\n\r\n“Help me!” I cried. It was dark, and cold. I couldn’t see anyone, no one was there. I stood up and started to walk, then run. I felt like I was going to run into an invisible wall at any moment, but I didn’t. I started to sweat as I ran. \r\n\r\nMy legs started to feel heavy, same with my arm. Suddenly, I heard the noise of an engine. I turned around and saw Gavin’s Charger racing after me. “Please don’t leave me!” he shouted from his car. I tried to run, but I kept getting heavier. \r\n\r\nThe car got closer. I fell, my legs were stuck in place. Gavin’s car drove right over me, but I didn’t feel anything. “Help me!” I cried. Again, no one came. I was alone, alone in the dark.  \r\n\r\n… \r\n\r\nI shot up into a sitting position. I was covered in sweat, and dirt. My wounded leg had been bandaged by someone; blood had stained my pants and the bandage. Slowly, and with difficulty, I stood up and made my way to the door.  \r\n\r\nThe hallway was dimly lit, but I still could see. “Hell... Hello?” I croaked. Avery appeared from the kitchen. He smiled, then embraced me in a hug. “How are you doing?” he asked. I shrugged. “Hurt, but okay.” He pulled away from me, then led me to the couch. \r\n\r\nI practically fell onto the cushion; I couldn’t even hold myself up. Jenni was sitting in the armchair across from me, and Tessa was on the floor beside her sister. “What... What happened?” I asked. Jenni looked at Avery, then he looked at me. It was like there was some dark secret between them, just staring at each other, deciding what to say. \r\n\r\n“Noah, I killed the Reaper,” Avery finally said. “You had lost so much blood we barley saved you.” I leaned back into the couch. “I figured,” I said calmly. “Is there anything else?” Avery sighed, but Jenni spilled first. “Were leaving, Noah,” she said. “To Newyork, the haven. That’s better than this.” \r\n\r\nAgain, I figured so. “Well, when do we leave?” I asked. Avery smiled. “As soon as your leg heals.” I rolled my eyes, then stood up. “I\'m fine.” After I took a step, I fell to the floor, pain shooting up my leg. “Please... Just help me,” I asked. Jenni sighed, then got up from her chair. \r\n\r\n', 'I stepped over the mossy log and continued down the hill. The forest was cool, unlike the city, dirty, and full of the smell of dead corpses.

(58, 47, 'The Lost Soul', 'The bar was crowded, but not enough to block the flash of light I caught in the corner of my eye. Did someone just take a picture of me? I looked around, hoping to find the culprit, but my efforts were in vain. I took another sip of my drink, I turned my mind to other matters, which being the hot stud playing pool. It has been a while since I slept with anyone, and if wanted anyone to break my dry spell, he would be my choice. Downing my drink, I hopped off the barstool and began to stagger towards the pool table. Before I even took two steps, the room started to spin. The room began to spin faster and faster. I reached for the barstool to steady myself, but before I could grasp it, a pair of hands grabbed my waist.\r\n\r\nA gentle voice whispered in my ears, “Easy, Vicky. It seems you’ve had a little too much to drink.”\r\n\r\nAs my mind disappeared in a fog of confusion, I heard myself ask, “How do you know my name?” Then everything went dark.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure how long I out, but when I came to my senses, I knew something was terribly wrong. I found myself lying on a cold surface, in a lifeless body. Why can’t I move, I thought? Is this a dream, where I find myself frozen in time? The distant sound of heavy breathing answered my question. This was no dream. The feeling I was being watched began to overshadow me. As I tried to open my eyes, I quickly discovered they resisted my command. Again, I tried and after wrestling with their resistance to opening, I found myself the victor.\r\n\r\nThe glare of fluorescent lights burned the back of my eyes, and they instantly closed again. I wasn’t sure if I was gaining more control over my faculties, but when I attempted to reopen my eyes, I was met with less resistance. This time, I let my eyes adjust to the light, and a moment later, I found myself amidst unfamiliar surroundings. The room was unusually clean, spotless to be exact. Stainless steel benches were affixed to the walls, and on those benches were plastic buckets, filled with unknown chemicals. On the wall at the far end of the room was a small metal door, with an even smaller window at the center of it. Again, I asked myself, where am I?\r\n\r\nAs if my thoughts were spoken aloud, a voice from a corner of the room answered, “I’m glad to see you’re awake, Vicky.”\r\n\r\nAs I tried to speak, my voice was raspy and barely more than a whisper. “How do you know my name?”\r\n\r\nA man stepped out of the shadows, entering my field of vision. His was tall and thin, with dark hair and was probably in his mid-twenties. He looked like any other man who could have passed on the street, and you’d wouldn’t remember him.\r\n\r\n“I took the liberty of going through your pocketbook,” he replied. “Your name is Victoria Lightfoot, but I’m sure your friends call you Vicky. I can call you Vicky, can’t I?” He continued without waiting for an answer. “Lightfoot, eh? American Native I presume. Good. Then you should appreciate what I’m doing here.”\r\n\r\n“Who are you, and what have you done to me?” Vicky garbled out. “Why am I here?”\r\n\r\n“My name is Arman, and the good news is, I brought you here to save your soul. As to what I have done to you, is simple. I slipped Liquid X, a date rape drug in your drink. Then I took you from the Bar of the Damned and brought you here to purge your soul of all the poison it has ingested during your lifetime. Of course, I had to make sure you wouldn’t try to escape, so I injected you with atracurium, a paralytic drug doctors use for surgery to make sure you don’t move during an operation.” Arman laughed. “It just occurred to me. considering I’m performing a certain type of operation, atracurium seems be a proper piece of the puzzle.”\r\n\r\nArman may have thought it was funny, but I was horrified. Struck with fear, my mind began to race. “What is he going to do to me? Am I going to die?” But the most important question I asked myself was, “How am I going to get out of here?” with all my might, I tried to command my legs to move, but it was as if I was disconnected from my body. “How long does this drug last? In time, I might be able to move again.” Somehow, I have to stall him. “So, Arman, if that’s you real name, where did you get these drugs? I doubt if you pick them up from the local pharmacy.”\r\n\r\nA glimmer of pride shown from Arman’s eyes. “To tell the truth, I work as an IT Specialist at the National Institutes of Health. Now, you may ask yourself, how could an IT guy have access to exotic medication such as ketamine and atracurium? You’d be surprised how simple it is. You see, I have access to all the labs and storage areas containing computer equipment and as for security? It nearly non-existent behind those closed doors. Oh, you’d be surprised what I have stored in my medicine cabinet.”\r\n\r\nAs those words rung through my ears, I noticed my toes began to tingle. The drug is wearing off! Just a little more time and I might be able to escape. I must continue distracting him. “So, tell me Arman, how are you planning to save my soul?”\r\n\r\nArman scoffed. “Me? I’m not going to do a thing. You’re going to do that.”\r\n\r\n Inwardly, I started to feel hopeful. I can wiggle my toes now. Just a little more time. “Exactly, what do I have to do?” I asked.\r\n\r\nBefore Arman could answer, a chime of a timer blared out. “Time for another shot, Vicky. I wouldn’t want you to get any ideas about escaping.” He stretched his hand towards a workbench and picked up a syringe.\r\n\r\nAs I realized what he was about to do, I began to panic. “Don’t do it! I won’t resist. I promise.”\r\n\r\nBut Arman wouldn’t listen, and I was powerless to stop him. He lifted my lifeless arm and administered a dose of atracurium. “I would like to believe you, but I don’t. You don’t know how many of the others have said the same thing.”\r\n\r\nTerror overwhelmed me when I discovered I wasn’t his first victim. How many were there before me, and even worse, how many will be after me? as the sensation in my feet disappeared, all feelings of hope vanished with it. “I need more time, but it’s useless.” Suddenly, an idea came to mind. I may not be able to get time, but maybe there’s another way I can get free. “Arman.” I called out. “If I want to save my soul, what do I have to do?”\r\n\r\n“Simple,” Arman hissed. “Confess all your sins to God, and with all of your heart, pray for forgiveness. If you do that, your soul will be cleansed, and you’ll be freed.”\r\n\r\nCould it be that simple, I thought? If he hears my confession, will he let me go? There was only one way to find out.\r\n\r\n“Oh, God, please listen to this wretched soul,” I began. “I have sinned, not only against you, but to all those who have touched my life. My drinking and sleeping around was only for my pleasure and nothing more. I swear, from this day on, I will never taste alcohol, or sleep with another out of wedlock. Please Lord, through your merciful heart, please forgive me, a sinner.”\r\n\r\nWhen I was finished, I felt her eyes tear up. Though my body remained motionless, I was trembling in thought, as the weight of guilt eased off my shoulders. “Do you think God heard me?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It was a beautiful confession, Vicky. I’m sure God will forgive you and answer your prayer.”\r\n\r\nThough I was afraid of what the answer might be, I bravely asked, “Will you let me go now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will set you free, free from the body which corrupts your soul through sin. You are a creature of the earth and thus doomed to sin again. Now that your soul is clean, how can I let you stain it again? Now is the time to separate your soul from your body and let it soar to eternal life in Heaven.”\r\n\r\nFear struck my heart when I heard those words. “No! You can’t,” I stuttered. “They’ll catch you if you do this. Just let me go and I swear I’ll won’t anyone about this. Please!”\r\n\r\n“Oh Vicky, how kind it is of you to think about me, but you don’t have to worry about that. You can ask the others why that is, when you ascend to Heaven. Do you know where we are right now?” Armand continued, “We’re in a morgue, the crematorium to be exact. I work here part time as a janitor and have access to the building 24-7.” He pointed to the small door with the window. “That’s the cremation chamber. It’s there where your corrupt body will be purified by fire, and later I’ll scatter your ashes in the cemetery. The plan is quite simple, no body to discover and no questions asked. So, like I said. You have nothing to worry about.”\r\n\r\nVicky began to whimper. “You can’t kill me. That’s a sin! Don’t want to sin, do you? Don’t do it. I want to live. Please, please give me a second chance!”\r\n\r\nArman reached towards the bench and retrieved another syringe. “Don’t worry, Vicky. Once I give you this, you’ll fall asleep and won’t feel a thing. The next thing you’ll know, you’ll be in Heaven thanking me for what I’ve done. No, I’m not killing you. I’m giving you a new life.” With that, he stuck the needle in her arm and pressed the plunger. He watched as Vicky’s eyes fluttered for a second and then closed.\r\n\r\n“There, there, Vicky. Be at peace.” Arman opened the cremation chamber door and gently slid Vicky’s body inside it. After he closed the door and threw the switch, the flames ignited and began disintegrating Vicky’s body. Arman then took his phone out of his pocket and glanced at its photo album. There, was a picture of Vicky at the bar. He smiled and placed the phone back in his pocket. “It is finished. Tomorrow morning I’ll spread the ashes and later that afternoon, I’ll check the bar at the other side of the county. Looking for lost sheep is my calling, and I am the good shepherd. Thy work will be done.”\r\n', 'The bar was crowded, but not enough to block the flash of light I caught in the corner of my eye. Did someone just take a picture of me? I looked around, hoping to find the culprit, but my efforts were in vain. I took another sip of my drink, I turned my mind to other matters, which being the hot stud playing pool. It has been a while since I slept with anyone, and if wanted anyone to break my dry spell, he would be my choice. Downing my drink, I hopped off the barstool and began to stagger towards the pool table. Before I even took two steps, the room started to spin. The room began to spin faster and faster. I reached for the barstool to steady myself, but before I could grasp it, a pair of hands grabbed my waist.', 'horror', 1, 1, 0, '{}', '2022-06-20 04:52:17', 0, 0),
(59, 48, 'Just Ask For Mercy', '*Content warning- some violence and gore*\r\n\r\nSomething is eating the hostas.\r\n\r\nIt’s a tricky section of the garden- shaded and north-facing- but the foliage thrives under my watchful eye. I ensure it grows lush and verdant, and only I can coax it from sulking in this hot, dry weather. I’m pleased to see the blue-green tones of sieboldiana flourishing beside the golden variegated undulates leaves.\r\n\r\nI‘m outraged by the pock-marked damage I’ve discovered, and search for the culprit amongst the ovate leaves. There! A snail clings to the underside of a leaf, sucked close in a non-consensual and greedy kiss. I prise it off and the shell implodes in my pincer grip, crushed mush oozing between my fingertips. I discard the muck onto the soil with disdain, satisfied that feeder has now become food.\r\n\r\nA gardener must be brutal, constantly battling soft bodied grubs, mandible-fanged pests, plagues of aphids and creeping insidious blight, all in order to protect the precious shoots and trembling new leaves. She must also have a hard, calculating heart to destroy what was previously nurtured, cutting back and curbing life when the time comes, sacrificing what was once so carefully created. I, the gardener, am like God; through me nature flows, giving vigour to the strong and enabling the weak and damaged to pass.\r\n\r\nInside the house the landline telephone clamours, taking seven rings for Mrs Nolan to stir from her armchair doze and mobilise her arthritic joints to answer it. Crouched here beneath the open kitchen window I am perfectly placed to eavesdrop what she says.\r\n\r\n“Hello, this is Miriam…\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m as well as can be expected. And you?\r\n\r\n“Yes, a very hot spell. The garden’s very thirsty…\r\n\r\n“Oh…really? You’re too kind! Honestly, it’s too much…\r\n\r\n“It’s an absolute honour. I can’t quite take it all in. Trevor would have been so pleased. So very, very pleased…\r\n\r\n“Thank you ever so much. It’s all such a surprise!\r\n\r\n“I certainly will, and you too. Cheerio.”\r\n\r\nThe telephone pings as it’s replaced in its cradle, and I sense Mrs Nolan shuffling along to the back door to find me. I muse over the emotional wobble I overheard in her voice. She’s been prone to tears since Mr Nolan’s unfortunate accident and numerous well meaning villagers have phoned to offer comfort, but this call was a curious one and I’m keen to be enlightened.\r\n\r\n“Mercy, are you there?”\r\n\r\n“Right over here, Mrs Nolan.” I sound as sweet as maple syrup.\r\n\r\nMrs Nolan emerges from the side of the house, blinking in the bright sunshine, taking a moment to locate me by the shadowy border.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had the most remarkable news, Mercy. The Village Committee have nominated me for the Best Blooming Garden award. How kind of them! I’m sure it’s Trevor’s dahlias that persuaded the judges; he took such meticulous care of them. Trevor deserved the nomination, not me- he’d have been so proud- but it’s too late…”\r\n\r\nBoth Mrs Nolan and I glance involuntarily to the place on the lawn where Mr Nolan was found. I am pleasantly surprised to notice how prolifically the daisies are growing. They’re clearly thriving from minerals in Mr Nolan’s blood.\r\n\r\nHere we go. Mrs Nolan’s eyes are welling up and her chin is wobbling. I stand, knit my eyebrows together with a show of concern and gently usher her back indoors to put the kettle on.\r\n\r\nThat’s when I know there is no hope left for Mrs Nolan. A well-meaning nomination- probably from sympathy votes- has exacerbated her misery and reduced her to convulsive weeping, proving any pleasure in life is now well beyond her grasp. What particularly irks me is that the dahlias were mostly attended to by myself, at least ever since Mr Nolan’s stroke last year, and I’ve exclusively cared for them since his recent demise. The dahlias, the roses, those blousy, vulgar petunias that Mrs Nolan chose and I obediently bedded in- the nomination is all thanks to me.\r\n\r\nThe world has no place for the old and feeble. In this very garden, right under our noses, nature uses all manner of macabre means to ensure order is kept; pincers, stingers, poisons, parasites that eat their host slowly from within. Although violent, these acts are essentially a great kindness. A kindness Mrs Nolan now deserves.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nI ponder my options.\r\n\r\nWhilst some impulsivity was involved with Mr Nolan, this time I\'ll carefully consider my plan.\r\n\r\nNot to say last time wasn’t efficient and effective.\r\n\r\nI’d taken great care that afternoon to prune the privet hedge to perfection. I was clearing away the cuttings- gloved, as the sap can sting- whilst Mr Nolan limped up and down, pedantically questioning some cross branch irregularities he perceived in the shrubs. I pitied him, unable as he was to appreciate my work and no longer able to manage the shears himself with one useless arm. It was the least I could do to relieve him of his agitation once and for all.\r\n\r\nStepping close, I plunged the points of the shears into his fleshy, cotton-shirted paunch, which gave little more resistance than a fish belly, and slid the blades upwards under his ribs. It was remarkably easy. This single moment of pain was all it took to free him from his frustrated, failing body. A poppy-crimson stain blossomed under his spread fingers as he clutched his gut in a futile attempt to hold back the seeping blood. Before my eyes his pallid face became slack-jawed with disbelief. He gurgled and spluttered, eyes bulging pleadingly, but there was nothing left to be said. As he staggered, I gently grasped him by the shoulders and guided him down to the ground face first, so the blade tips emerged through his back like fresh new shoots.\r\n\r\nIt looked every bit the tragic accident; the clumsy fall of a foolish man carrying tools he couldn’t handle, when he should have left the work for the gardener. I removed the remaining cuttings under the pretence I’d left much earlier, and left him for Mrs Nolan to find after she returned from the Parish cake sale.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a similarly violent end for Mrs Nolan would be fitting. I’m briefly excited by the thought of her pale wrists cut to scarlet ribbons by secateurs- driven to suicide by grief, of course. I suspect the bleeding out could take some time and given the neighbours\' windows will be wide open in the summer heat, enabling them to hear her screams, maybe this is an unwise option.\r\n\r\nA fall on the patio? I think of Mrs Nolan’s head as the snail shell crushed between my fingers and wonder if one blow would be enough. Multiple blows would be inconsistent with a fall, raising suspicions that could compromise the innocent image I’m associated with throughout the village. I’m reluctant to take such risk.\r\n\r\nMy eyes narrow thoughtfully as I scan the tapestry of summer petalled foliage in the garden borders.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nMrs Nolan’s made a Victoria Sponge. She tells me it’s to celebrate the Best Blooming Garden nomination, but I can see her tired old heart’s not in it. Nevertheless we’re both playing along with her pointless charade, while it lasts.\r\n\r\n“Do have a slice before you go,” she urges me. “I’ll wrap up an extra slice for you to take home.”\r\n\r\nWe’re sat at her little kitchen table. I’ve taken Mr Nolan’s chair as I’m curious to see her reaction, but she doesn’t comment. She’s adored my company since he’s been gone- evidence of her lonely, pitiful existence. My heart swells to think that soon I’ll have released her from her misery.\r\n\r\n“Won’t you have any tea, Mercy?” She looks quizzically over the top of her cup at my untouched one.\r\n\r\n“I’m enjoying the delicious cake, Mrs Nolan.” I’m certainly glowing with anticipation; not at the sickly slice on my plate, but to see beads of sweat break out on her forehead.\r\n\r\nMrs Nolan raises a hand her heart, probably feeling some palpitations. “Mercy, you’ve been a rock over these last few weeks. I don’t know how I would have coped without you,” she tells me earnestly.\r\n\r\nA curious sensation passes through me; a brief flicker of guilt, possibly even doubt. After all, it’s not too late, is it? I push the inconvenient emotions away, remembering my role as gardener requires ruthless management of the weak and sickly, and I wait.\r\n\r\nIt’s all happening fast now. Panic creeps into Mrs Nolan’s face as her heart begins to gallop like wild horses. She gasps, reaches out a hand towards me but knocks my plate of cake onto the floor. Both smash into pieces on the tiles.\r\n\r\nDigitalis Perurea, a cottage garden favourite commonly known as the foxglove, is an excellent pollinator adding height and structure to summer borders. It’s also highly toxic. The foxgloves I propagated have been glorious this year, in my opinion outshining the dahlias by far. From the unripe green seeds I’ve ground a paste and steeped it in the tea that Mrs Nolan’s poured from the pot. Her cup stands empty on the table, white and fluted like the trumpet of a foxglove flower.\r\n\r\nI watch closely and am certain Mrs Nolan experiences minimal pain as her racing heart outruns itself, my face disappearing from her view as her vision blurs and darkens. At her age, no one will suspect a thing.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThe village shop door tinkles as I enter, and I wait patiently while Janet serves a child buying sweets from one of the large jars on the shelf. I smile indulgently at the youngster who glances uneasily at me and takes a wary, wide sidestep around me as he leaves- so strange that children often sense their vulnerability better than their adult counterparts.\r\n\r\n“Mercy! How are you bearing up?” Janet is the picture of kind concern. “Such a blow to hear about Miriam. I heard you were there when she took poorly?”\r\n\r\n“It was terrible” I murmur, eyes downcast. “She’d never truly recovered from finding Mr Nolan in such a state.”\r\n\r\n“It was the shock, wasn’t it? And a broken heart. Maybe it’s all for the best.” Janet shudders before her bright demeanour returns. “What can I help you with?”\r\n\r\n“Could I pop a note in the window, please? To let people know I’m available for work.”\r\n\r\nWith Janet’s permission I take out from my bag the card I’ve carefully written my number on and slide it into one of the plastic sleeves hanging in the shop window. It’s placed alongside local business cards and adverts for piano tuition and babysitting.\r\n\r\nIn my neat, orderly cursive I’ve written my number and a friendly message. I’m confident there will be a good response, especially as the Best Blooming Garden award is still up for grabs.\r\n\r\nDoes your garden need some love and care?\r\n\r\nCall now for experienced help.\r\n\r\nJust ask for Mercy.', '*Content warning- some violence and gore*\r\n\r\nSomething is eating the hostas.\r\n\r\nIt’s a tricky section of the garden- shaded and north-facing- but the foliage thrives under my watchful eye.
